This language-specific relation is used for relative clauses in Norwegian and the `acl:relcl` relation is assigned to the main predicate of the relative clause. Relative clauses modify a nominal element and are often initiated by the relative pronoun *som* "that" which is assigned a nominal relation to the main predicate of the relative clause.
