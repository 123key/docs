This language-specific relation is used for verbal particles in Norwegian and describes the relation of the particle to its verbal head. Particles exhibit a number of syntactic properties which sets them apart from regular prepositions. For instance, a pronominal object may intercede the verb and the preposition in the particle case *satte den på* "put it on", but not in the case of a regular preposition and its complement _*lette den etter_ "*looked it for",  and only complements of a preposition may occur in an impersonal passive *Det ble lett etter den nye boka* "It was looked for the new book", but an object in a particle construction may not _*Det ble satt den på_ "*It was put it on".
