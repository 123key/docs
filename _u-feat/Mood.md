Mood
is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb
forms.

### Ind: indicative

The
indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative
merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen,
without adding any attitude of the speaker.

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Studuješ</I></span><I>
na univerzitě.</I> [de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Du studierst</I></span><I>
an der Universität.</I>
(<span style='color: red'>You
study</span> at the university.)

### Imp: imperative

The
speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Studuj</I></span><I>
na univerzitě!</I> [de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Studiere</I></span><I>
an der Universität!</I>
(<span style='color: red'>S</span><span style='color: red'>tudy</span>
at the university!)

### Cnd: conditional

The
conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).

Examples:
[cs] <I>Kdy</I><span style='color: red'><I>bych</I></span><I>
byl chytrý, studoval </I><span style='color: red'><I>bych</I></span><I>
na univerzitě.</I>
(If
I were smart I <span style='color: red'>would</span>
study at the university;
note that only the auxiliary <I>bych</I>
is specific to conditional; the active participle <I>byl</I>
is also needed to analytically form the conditional mood, however, it
will only be tagged as participle because it can also be used to form
past tense indicative.)

### Pot: potential

The
action of the verb is likely but not certain. Used e.g. in Finnish.

### Sub: subjunctive / conjunctive

The
subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in subordinate
clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or otherwise
uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the conditional
meaning.

Examples:
[fr] <I>Je veux que tu le </I><span style='color: red'><I>fasses</I></span><I>.</I>
(I want you to do it; lit. I want that you it
do.Sub.)

### Jus: jussive

The
jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens. Used e.g.
in Arabic.

### Qot: quotative

The
quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.

### Opt: optative

Used
e.g. in Turkish in exclamations like &ldquo;May you have a long
life!&rdquo; or &ldquo;If only I were rich!&rdquo;

### Des: desiderative

The
desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb &ldquo;want to&rdquo;:
&ldquo;He <span style='color: red'>wants to come</span>.&rdquo;
Used e.g. in Turkish.

### Nec: necessitative

The
necessitative
mood corresponds to the modal verbs
&ldquo;must, should, have to&rdquo;:
&ldquo;He <span style='color: red'>must</span><span style='color: red'>
come</span>.&rdquo; Used e.g. in Turkish.
