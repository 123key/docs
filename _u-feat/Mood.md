Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě._ "<b>You study</b> at the
  university."
* [de] _<b>Du studierst</b> an der Universität._ "<b>You study</b> at
  the university."
* [tr] *eve <b>gidiyor</b>* "she is going home"
* [tr] *eve <b>gitti</b>* "she went home"

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"
* [de] _<b>Studiere</b> an der Universität!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"
* [tr] *eve <b>git</b>* "go home!"
* [tr] *eve <b>gidin</b>* "go home!" (plural)
* [tr] *eve <b>gitsin</b>* "[let him] go home!" (3rd person imperative)

### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).

#### Examples

* [cs] <i>Kdy<b>bych</b> byl chytrý, studoval <b>bych</b> na
  univerzitě.</i> "If I were smart I <b>would</b> study at the
  university" (note that only the auxiliary _bych_ is specific to
  conditional; the active participle _byl_ is also needed to
  analytically form the conditional mood, however, it will only be
  tagged as participle because it can also be used to form past tense
  indicative.)
* [tr] *eve <b>gittiyse</b>* "if she went home"
* [tr] *eve <b>gidiyorsa</b>* "if she is going home"
* [tr] *eve <b>giderse</b>* "if she goes home"
* [tr] *eve <b>gidecekdiyse</b>* "if she was going to go home"

### `Pot`: potential

The action of the verb is possible but not certain.
This mood corresponds to the modal verbs _can, might, be able to_.
Used e.g. in Finnish.

#### Examples

* [tr] *eve <b>gidebilir</b>* "she can go home"
* [tr] *eve <b>gidemeyebilir</b>* "she may not be able to go home"

### `Sub`: subjunctive / conjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the
conditional meaning.

#### Examples

* [fr] <i>Je veux que tu le <b>fasses</b></i> "I want you to do it" lit. <i>I
  want that you it do</i><tt>.Sub</tt>

### `Jus`: jussive

The jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens; it is thus close to both imperative and optative.
Unlike in desiderative, it is the speaker, not the subject who wishes that it happens.
Used e.g. in Arabic.

### `Qot`: quotative

The quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.

### `Opt`: optative

Expresses exclamations like "May you have a long life!" or "If only I were rich!"
In Turkish it also expresses suggestions.

#### Examples

* [tr] *eve <b>gidelim</b>* 'let's go home'

### `Des`: desiderative

The desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb "want to": "He
<b>wants to come</b>." Used e.g. in Turkish.

### `Nec`: necessitative

The necessitative mood expresses necessity and corresponds to the modal verbs "must, should,
have to": "He <b>must</b><b> come</b>."

#### Examples

* [tr] *eve <b>gitmeli</b>* 'she should go home'
* [tr] *eve <b>gitmeliydi</b>* 'she should have gone home'
