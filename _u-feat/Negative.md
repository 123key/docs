Negativeness is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), sometimes also [adverbs](u-pos/ADV) and
[nouns](u-pos/NOUN) in languages that negate using bound
morphemes. For instance, all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated
using the prefix <I>ne-</I>.  In English, verbs are negated using the
[particle](u-pos/PART) <I>not</I> and adjectives are also negated
using prefixes, although the process is less productive than in Czech
<I>(wise &ndash; unwise, probable &ndash; improbable)</I>.

Note that `Negative=Neg` is not the
same thing as <tt><a href="PronType.html">PronType</a>=Neg</tt>. For pronouns and other pronominal parts
of speech there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and
adjectives. (There is no such thing as &ldquo;affirmative pronoun&rdquo;.)

The negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
[interjections](u-pos/INTJ) <I>yes</I> and <I>no</I>.

### Pos: positive, affirmative

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>přišel</I></span>
(he came)

### Neg: negative

Examples: [cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>nepřišel</I></span>
(he did not come)
