For
Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

### Act: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the
action (agent), the object is affected by the action (pacient).

Examples: [cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Napadli</I></span><I>
jsme nepřítele.</I>
(We
<span style='color: red'>attacked</span>
the enemy; the active participle <I>napadli</I>
can
be used to form either past tense or conditional mood; here it forms
the past tense.)

### Pass: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the
action (pacient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or it
appears as an object of the verb.

Examples: [cs] <I>J</I><I>sme
</I><span style='color: red'><I>napadeni</I></span><I>
nepřítelem.</I>
(We
are <span style='color: red'>attacked</span>
by the enemy; the passive participle <I>napadeni</I>
is
used to form passive in all tenses; here it forms the present
passive.)

### Rcp: reciprocal voice

Examples: [tr]
<span style='color: red'><I>karıştı</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>tutuştular</I></span>

### Cau: causative voice

<A HREF="https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf">Documentation</A>
of the METU Sabanci treebank classifies causative as voice (page 26).
Note that this is a feature of verbs. There are languages that have
also the causative case of nouns.

Examples: [tr]
<span style='color: red'><I>karıştırıyor</I></span>
(is
confusing)
