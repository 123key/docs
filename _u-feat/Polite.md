Various
languages have various means to express politeness or respect; some
of the means are morphological.

In
quite a few languages the polite mode involves changing pronoun,
person or number when addressing or talking about a respectable
person. In Czech, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> person plural is used instead of
singular; this involves both the pronoun and the finite verb but not
a participle, which remains in singular. In this case, different
words are selected but all of them also exist in the informal mode.
The change is that morphological plural may now be either semantic
singular or plural.

In
German, Spanish or Hindi, both number and person are changed
(morphological 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
person is used as semantic 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
person) and in addition, special pronouns are used that do not appear
in the informal register ([de] <I>Sie</I>;
[es] <I>usted,
ustedes</I>;
[hi] आप
<I>āpa</I>).

In
Japanese, verbs
and other words have polite and informal forms but
the polite register is not restricted to addressing people.

### `Inf`: informal register

Usage
varies but if the language distinguishes levels of politeness, then
the informal register is usually meant for communication with family
members and close friends.

Examples:
[cs]
_<b>ty jdeš / vy jdete</b>_ (you go.Sing/Plur);
[de]
_<b>du gehst / ihr geht</b>_ (you go.Sing/Plur);
[es]
_<b>tú vas / vosotros vais</b>_ (you go.Sing/Plur);
[ja]
<b>行かない _ikanai_</b> (will not go).

### `Pol`: polite register

Usage
varies but if the language distinguishes levels of politeness, then
the polite register is usually meant for communication with strangers
and people of higher social status than the one of the speaker.

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>vy
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>jdete</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur);
[de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Sie
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>gehen</I></span>
(you go.Sing/Plur); [es] <span style='color: red'><I>usted
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>va
/ ustedes van</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur); [ja]
<span style='color: red'>行きません
<I>ikimasen</I></span>
(will
not go).
