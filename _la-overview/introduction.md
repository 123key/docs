# Introduction

The Latin UD treebank is based on the
[Latin Dependency Treebank 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data) (LDT),
currently maintained at Leipzig University (Humboldt Chair in DH, Prof. Gregory Crane).
The treebank consists of literary texts of different genres.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Latin UD treebank is the result of
a conversion of part of the [LDT 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/v2.0/Latin) data. The conversion has been made by Giuseppe G. A. Celano.
