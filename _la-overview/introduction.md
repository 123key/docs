# Introduction

UD currently contains three related - but not yet completely homogenous - treebanks for Latin (more details within the specific documentations): 

* The Latin UD treebank is based on the
[Latin Dependency Treebank 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data) (LDT),
currently maintained at Leipzig University (Humboldt Chair in DH, Prof. Gregory Crane).
The treebank consists of literary texts of different genres mainly from the Classical age. The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Latin UD treebank is the result of a conversion of part of the [LDT 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/v2.0/Latin) data. The conversion has been made by Giuseppe G. A. Celano.

* The Latin PROIEL treebank is based on the Latin data from the PROIEL treebank, which is maintained at the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Arts and Ideas at the University of Oslo. The treebank contains most of the Vulgate New Testament translation plus selections from Caesar's Gallic War and Cicero's Letters to Atticus. The data have been automatically converted to the UD scheme by Dag Haug. 

* The Latin-ITTB UD treebank is based on the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB), currently maintained at Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy. The treebank consists of texts by Thomas Aquinas. The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Latin-ITTB UD treebank is the result of a conversion process made by Marco Passarotti (Milan) and Dan Zeman (Prague).
