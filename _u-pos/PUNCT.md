### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and _ยง_, which are instead tagged as <a href="SYM.html">SYM</a>.

### Examples

 - Period: _<span style='color:red'>.</span>_
 - Comma: _<span style='color:red'>,</span>_
 - Parentheses: _<span style='color:red'>()</span>_
