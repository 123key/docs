### Definition

**Adverbs** are words that typically modify <a href="VERB.html">verbs</a> for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify <a href="ADJ.html">adjectives</a> and other adverbs, as in _<span style='color:red'>very briefly</span>_ or _<span style='color:red'>arguably</span> wrong_.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the {{ page.title }} part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as verbal particles, as in _write <span style='color:red'>down</span>_ or _end <span style='color:red'>up</span>_. They are still tagged {{ page.title }} and not <a href="PART.html">PART</a>.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our universal tagging scheme. In particular, _adverbial ordinal numerals_ ([cs] _poprv√©_ = for the first time) and _multiplicative numerals_ (e.g. _once, twice_) behave syntactically as adverbs and are tagged {{ page.title }}.

Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either <a href="VERB.html">VERB</a> or {{ page.title }}.
