## {{ page.title }}: {{ page.shortdef }}

### Definition

The tag {{ page.title }} is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. 

A special usage of {{ page.title }} is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is typically used in the syntactic analysis). 
This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech. For example, in _he put on a large sombrero_, _sombrero_ is an ordinary <a href="NOUN.html">NOUN</a>.

### Examples

 - _And then he just <span style='color:red'>xfgh pdl jklw</span>_
