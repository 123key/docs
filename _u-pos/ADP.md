### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions. Adpositions belong to a closed set of items that
occur before (preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and that form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

In many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword expressions, such as _in spite of_, _because of_, _thanks to_. The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (_in_ is ADP, _spite_ is <a href="NOUN.html">NOUN</a>, etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

Note that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function as verbal particles, as in _give <span style='color:red'>in</span>_ or _hold <span style='color:red'>on</span>_. They are still tagged ADP and not <a href="PART.html">PART</a>.

### Examples

 - _in_
 - _to_
