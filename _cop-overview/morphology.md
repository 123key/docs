# Morphology

**Universal Part of Speech Tags**

In keeping with other Universal Dependency treebanks, the Coptic dependency treebank also offers a mapping to the Universal Part of Speech tag set proposed in Petrov et al. (2012) and developed further into the version currently adopted by the UD project. However, unlike the syntactic annotation scheme, which we offer as the primary annotation guidelines for Coptic syntax, universal POS tags are very limited in their coarseness, and in many cases do not map well onto Coptic grammar. We therefore recommend the use of the Coptic specific Scriptorium tag set whenever possible. Below we list the mapping from Coptic Scriptorium to Universal POS tags, with some additional notes at the end.
