# Specific constructions

## Impersonal verbs

The small class of mostly Greek origin impersonal verbs takes subject clauses, such as ⲉⲝⲉⲥⲧⲓ 'it is appropriate', which points from main verb to subordinate verb with `csubj`:

~~~ sdparse
ⲟⲩⲕ ⲉⲝⲉⲥⲧⲓ/VERB ⲉ ⲁⲁ/VERB ϥ \n it is not appropriate to do it

csubj(ⲉⲝⲉⲥⲧⲓ, ⲁⲁ)
~~~
