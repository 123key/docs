## advcl: adverbial clause modifier

An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.), as a modifier not as a core complement 
(temporal clause, consequence, conditional clause, purpose
clause, etc.). The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an advmod) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.
