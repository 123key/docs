## dep: unspecified dependency

A dependency is labeled as *dep* when the system is unable to
determine a more precise dependency relation between two words.  This
may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in
the Stanford Dependency conversion software, a parser error, or
because of an unresolved long distance dependency.

<div class="sd-parse">
Then , as if to show that he could , \ldots
dep(show, if)
</div>
