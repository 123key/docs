*compound* is one of the three relations in USD for compounding.

It is used for 

- any kind of X<sup>0</sup> compounding: noun compounds (e.g., *phone book*), but also verb and
adjective compounds that are more common in other languages (such as
Persian or Japanese light verb constructions);

- for numbers (e.g., *three thousand books* gives *compound*(thousand,three));

- for particles of phrasal verbs (e.g., *put up*: *compound*(put,up)).

The two other compounding relations are:

- *mwe* for fixed grammaticized expressions with function words (e.g., *instead of*:
*mwe*(of,instead), Fr. plutôt que "rather than": *mwe*(que,plutôt))

- *name* for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements.
