## dislocated: dislocated

The *dislocated* relation is used for fronted elements that introduce the topic of a sentence, as in the following Japanese example:

<div class="sd-parse">
z\={o} wa hana ga nagai \n elephant TOPIC nose SUBJ long-PRES
dislocated(nagai-5, z\={o}-1)
</div>


It is also used for postposed elements. Right dislocated elements are frequent in spoken languages: e.g., French

<div class="sd-parse">

dobj(manger,-5, la-4)
dislocated(faut-2, plasticine-7)
</div>
