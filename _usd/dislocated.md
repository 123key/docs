## dislocated: dislocated elements

The *dislocated* relation is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. 

It is used for fronted elements that introduce the topic of a sentence, as in the following Japanese example:

<div class="sd-parse">
象 wa hana ga nagai \n elephant TOPIC nose SUBJ long-PRES
dislocated(nagai-5, 象-1)
</div>


It is also used for postposed elements. Right dislocated elements are frequent in spoken languages: e.g., French

<div class="sd-parse">
Il faut pas la manger, la plasticine \n must not it eat the playdough
dobj(manger,-5, la-4)
dislocated(faut-2, plasticine-7)
</div>
