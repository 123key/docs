# Morphology

The tagset behind BulTreeBank is described in the following stylebook of (Simov, Osenova and Slavcheva 2004): <a href="http://www.bultreebank.org/TechRep/BTB-TR03.pdf">BTB Technical Report N3</a>.

It is a positional tagset which encodes the part-of-speech and its grammatical features (when available). It contains nearly 700 tags, since Bulgarian is a morphologically rich language.
