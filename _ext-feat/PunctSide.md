## {{ page.title }}: {{ page.shortdef }}

Distinguishes between initial and final form of pairwise punctuation
(brackets, quotation marks, question and exclamation in Spanish). Note
that "initial" and "final" are better terms than "left" and
"right". The latter would be confusing in languages writing from right
to left, like Arabic.

### Ini: initial (left bracket in English texts)

### Fin: final (right bracket in English texts)
