shortdef: 'is this a foreign word?'

Boolean feature. Is this a foreign word? Not a loan word and not a
foreign name but a genuinely foreign word appearing inside native
text, e.g. inside direct speech, titles of books etc. This feature
would apply either to the "X" part of speech (unanalyzable token), or
to other parts of speech if we know and are willing to annotate the
class to which the word belongs in its original language.

### Yes: it is foreign

Example: He said I could "dra Ã¥t helvete!"
