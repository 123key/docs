## Number[abs], Number[erg], Number[dat]

Finite verbs in many Indo-European languages agree in person and [number](u-feat/Number) with their subject.
In Basque (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypersonal_agreement">polypersonal language</a>),
certain verbs overtly mark agreement with up to three arguments:
one in the absolutive [case](u-feat/Case),
one in ergative and
one in dative.
Thus in _dakarkiogu_ “we bring it to him/her”,
_akar_ is the stem (_ekarri_ = “bring”),
_d_ stands for “it” (absolutive argument is the direct object of transitive verbs),
_ki_ stands for the dative case,
_o_ stands for “he” and
_gu_ stands for “we” (ergative argument is the subject of transitive verbs).

* `Number[abs]` is the number of the absolutive argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called `absnumber`.
* `Number[erg]` is the number of the ergative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called `ergnumber`.
* `Number[dat]` is the number of the dative argument of the verb. The corresponding feature in Interset 2.041 is called `datnumber`.
