## Main issues:


* The current documentation which is organized along relations rather than constructions makes it often hard to find the right analysis of a certain construction.
 * There is either a lot of redundancy (or conflicting statements) between the universal documentation and the language-specific documentation (in particular in the case of English) or very little to no language-specific documentation.
* Users have to go back and forth between the universal documentation and language-specific documentation and it is often not clear where to find the information.
* We have a lot of very productive GitHub discussions but there is no efficient process of transferring the results of a discussion from GitHub issues to the official documentation. Further, many interesting annotated examples are buried in the discussions.
* There is no efficient way to search for examples within the documentation. Currently, users can can only search in treebanks but there are no explanations attached to the results.
* Users might not know what a construction is called (or what we call it) but they might be able to search for it using a POS/surface token/dependency pattern.
