# Introduction

Ancient Greek is here defined as the Greek language from the first attested texts to 1453.

The Ancient Greek UD treebank is based on the
[Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data) (AGDT),
currently maintained at Leipzig University (Humboldt Chair in DH, Prof. Gregory Crane).
The treebank consists of literary texts of different genres.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Ancient Greek UD treebank is created through
a conversion of the [AGDT 2.0](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/v2.0/nonArethusaCompliant) data. The conversion has been made by Giuseppe G. A. Celano.
