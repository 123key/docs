# Tokenization

Ancient Greek tokenization is almost strictly graphic word-based, the language showing an almost perfect correspondence between graphic word and morphological word. More precisely, note the following:

* Clitics are already split from their phonological hosts in the original texts
* Crasis (i.e., contraction of a vowel/diphthong at the end of a word with a vowel/diphthong at the beginning of the following word) is resolved in the following cases:
  * article + any other word, such as in τοὐναντίον (i.e., τὸ ἐναντίον)
  * pronoun + any other word, such as in ἐγᾧδα (i.e., ἐγὼ οἶδα)
  * καί ('and') + any other word, such as in καὑτός (i.e., καὶ αὐτός)
  * Particles, such as ἄν and τοι, are never split
