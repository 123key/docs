# Tokenization

Ancient Greek tokenization is almost strictly graphic word-based, the language showing an almost perfect correspondence between graphic word and morphological word. More precisely, note the following:

* Clitics are already split from their phonological hosts in the original texts
* Crasis (i.e., contraction of a vowel/diphthong at the end of a word with a vowel/diphthong at the beginning of the following word) is resolved in the following cases:
  * article plus any other word
