In English, `Mood` is a feature of (finite)[VerbForm] (verbs)[en-pos/Verb]. It is used to express modality and further subclassify finite verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _He <b>makes</b> a sandwich._

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _<b>Make a sandwich!</b>_

### `Sub`: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain such as expressing an opinion or describing one's state of mind. It is also used to make statements contrary to fact.

* _I suggest that he <b>see</b> a doctor._
* _If I <b>were</b> rich..._

(Note that our automatic feature extractor only marks verbs with the POS tag `VB` with the subjunctive mood feature and therefore marks past tense verbs in subjunctive mood as indicative.)
