In English,  `Degree` is a feature of (adjectives)[en-pos/ADJ] and (adverbs)[en-pos/ADV].

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too. All words with PTB tags `JJ` or `RB` are marked with this
feature.

#### Examples

*  _<b>young</b> man_
* _The woman ran <b>fast</b>._

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object. All words with PTB tags `JJR` or `RBR` are marked with this
feature.

#### Examples

* _The man is <b>younger</b> than me._
* _She ran <b>faster</b> than anyone else._

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set. All words with PTB tags `JJS` or `RBS` are marked with this
feature.

#### Examples

* _This is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team._
* _<b>Best</b> of all, there are no ads._
