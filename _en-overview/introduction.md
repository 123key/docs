# Introduction

This is a gold standard Universal Dependencies corpus for English,
built over the source material of the Linguistic Data Consortium English Web Treebank
[LDC2012T13](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T13).

The corpus comprises 254,830 words and 16,622 sentences, taken from five genre of web media:
weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers. See the LDC2012T13 documentation for
more details on the source of the sentences.  The trees were automatically converted into Stanford
Dependencies and then hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies.  All the dependency annotations
have been single-annotated, a limited portion of them have been double-annotated, and subsequent correction has been done to improve consistency. Other aspects of the treebank, such as Universal POS and features, has mainly been done automatically, with very limited hand-correction.
