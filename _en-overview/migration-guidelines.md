The following list provides for each relation in the original Stanford Dependencies representation the name of
the equivalent relation in the Universal Dependencies representation. For some relations there doesn't exist
a 1:1 mapping. In these cases you'll find a description of how different instances of the relation are treated
according to the UD represenation. The list also provides the name of the GrammaticalRelation object as defined
in Stanford CoreNLP and the Stanford Parser.


### `acomp`: `xcomp`

`acomp` no longer exists as a relation in UD and is folded into [`xcomp`](en-dep/xcomp). 

### `advcl`: `advcl`
