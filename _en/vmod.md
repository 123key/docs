## vmod : reduced non-finite verbal modifier
A reduced non-finite verbal modifier is a participial or infinitive form of a verb heading a phrase (which may have some arguments, roughly like a VP). These are used to modify the meaning of an NP or another verb. They are not core arguments of a verb or full finite relative clauses.
