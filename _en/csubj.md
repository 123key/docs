## csubj : clausal subject

A clausal subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a clause, i.e.,
the subject is itself a clause. The governor of this relation might
not always be a verb: when the verb is a copular verb, the root of the
clause is the complement of the copular verb. In the two following
examples, "what she said" is the subject.

<div class="sd-parse">
What she said makes sense
csubj(makes, said)
</div>

<div class="sd-parse">
What she said is not true
csubj (true, said)
</div>
