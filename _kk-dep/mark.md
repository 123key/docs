A *marker* (`mark`) is the subordinating conjunction in a
non-complement subordinate clause.

The subordinating conjunctions in Kazakh are:

* _егер_ "if"
* _өйткені_ "because"

<!-- TODO: example with егер -->

The dependency relation `mark` is also used to identify the
*complementiser* appearing in most clausal complements, where the head
of the dependency is the main verb of the subordinate clause.
