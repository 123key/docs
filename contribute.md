# How to contribute to UD

If you want to add a new language/treebank, please read the [instructions](language_metadata.html) for adding a new language and encoding its metadata.

If you want to make a release of an existing treebank, please follow the steps in the [release checklist](release_checklist.html) and
make sure your data shows as validating in the [format validation runs](validation.html).
Check the [content validation](svalidation.html) for any suspicious patterns in the data;
there are direct links to our treebank search that you can use to browse the suspicious data points.
Check that the [list of contributors](contributors.html) is correct; this is gathered from the [metadata](language_metadata.html) in the READMEs. General instructions for contributing to the online documentation can be found [here](contributing.html).
