# How to contribute to UD

* If you want to use UD treebanks, [download](http://universaldependencies.org#download) them from LINDAT/CLARIN to make sure you get the latest official version.

* If you want to give feedback on UD guidelines or treebanks, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/issues) or send email to the UD list.

* If you want to start a treebank or contribute to a release, please follow the steps in the [release checklist](release_checklist.html).

<!-- Dan: There will be requirements for treebanks in CoNLL 2018, but we have to finalize the task specification first.
  * Specific to release 2.0: if you want your treebank included in the CoNLL 2017 shared task, [read this](http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/inclusion-rules.html) and [this](http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/internal-timeline.html).
-->

* If you want to contribute to language-specific documentation, follow these [guidelines](contributing_language_specific.html).

Please consider subscribing to the [UD mailing list](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/mailman/listinfo/ud), <strong>especially if you are going to contribute data.</strong> Important announcements for the data providers are circulated through this list.
