# How to contribute to UD

* If you want to use UD treebanks, download them from LINDAT/CLARIN to make sure you get the latest official version.

* If you want to give feedback on UD guidelines or treebanks, use the issue tracking system or send email to the UD list.

* If you want to start work on a new language/treebank, please read the [instructions](language_metadata.html) 
for adding a new language and encoding its metadata and then get in touch with our release and documentation team.

* If you want to contribute to a release, please follow the steps in the [release checklist](release_checklist.html) and make sure that your data passes [format validation](validation.html).
