# Extra material

This page contains material from the TDT guidelines that has not yet
been incorporated into the primary UD Finnish documentation. The
following should *not* be considered part of the UD Finnish
guidelines.

## 2.44 rel (relativizer)

(The following section was lifted from the TDT documentation for
`rel`, which is removed in UD Finnish. See
<https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/73> for more
information.)

In TDT, the *relativizer* (`rel`) is the head of the phrase containing
the relative pronoun (or other relative word). Most often, but not
always, this is the relative word itself. The governor of the
dependency is the main predicate of the relative clause.

For UD Finnish, relative markers are be mapped to the syntactic role
that the relative is playing in the relative clause, such as `nsubj`
or `dobj`. This information is present in the second annotation layer
of the TDT corpus.

<!-- TODO Annotation of relative clauses is more closely examined in Section [relclauses](#sec-relclauses). -->

**NOTE**: this is TDT example using `rel`, not a UD Finnish example.

## 2.47 The null token

The *null token* is not a dependency type, but an extra token that is
added into the sentence to represent a missing token. A null token is
only added when the missing token is required in order to construct an
analysis, that is, when it governs another token that is present in
the sentence. Thus, for instance copulas and auxiliaries are not
represented by null tokens when absent, because if they are absent,
their dependents are as well. The null token is most commonly, but not
always, a verb.

There are two basic uses for the null token in TDT. First, it is used
in *fragments*: sentences or clauses with an omitted main predicate.

~~~ sdparse
Presidentti *null* Kiinaan solmimaan sopimusta . \n The_president *null* to_China to_make a_deal .
nsubj(*null*-2, Presidentti-1)
nommod(*null*-2, Kiinaan-3)
xcomp(*null*-2, solmimaan-4)
dobj(solmimaan-4, sopimusta-5)
punct(*null*-2, .-6)
~~~

Second, the null token is used in *gapping*, a type of *ellipsis*
where a head word has been omitted to avoid repetition. Gapping is the
only type of ellipsis marked with null tokens, as according to the
definition of a null token, only words required for constructing an
analysis should be represented by one.
