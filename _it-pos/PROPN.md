### Definition

A proper noun is a noun that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

`PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names. When phrases or sentences are used as names, such as the title of a movie
or record, the component words retain their original tags. 
For example, in _Ultima fermata Brooklyn_ "Brooklyn last stop", _ultima_ is
[ADJ](), and _fermata_ is [NOUN]().

Adjectives or participles may however appear as part of a multiword noun that overall functions like a proper noun, for example in _Pagine Gialle_, _Mondo Giusto_ (*an association*) or
_A / 1_ (*a highway*).  

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _UN_ and _NATO_, are also tagged `PROPN`.

### Examples

- _Maria_, _Michelangelo_
- _Londra_
- _Ansaldo Energia_
- _Kim Il Sung_
- _NATO_, _HBO_
