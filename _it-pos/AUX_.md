### Definition

Auxiliary verbs are instances of the verbs _essere_ "to be" and _avere_ "to have"
used in connection with a main verb. They express grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, and mood.

_Modal verbs_, such as _dovere_ "to have to" and _potere_ "to can" may serve as auxiliary verbs. 


### Examples

- Tense auxiliaries: _<b>ha</b> fatto_ "he has done", _<b>è</b> arrivato_ "he has arrived", _<b>sarà</b> finito_ "it will be finished"
- Passive auxiliaries: _<b>fu</b> distrutto_ "it was destroyed", _<b>è stato</b> comprato_ "it ha been bought"
- Modal auxiliaries: _<b>dovrebbe</b> fare_ "he should do", _<b>può</b> avere successo_ "he can succeed"
