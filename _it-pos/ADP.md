### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.

In Italian, adpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before
(preposition) a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and
that form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _invece di_, _a causa di_, _davanti a_. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_a_ is `ADP`, _causa_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions is accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

See [mwe]() for more on multi-word expressions.
