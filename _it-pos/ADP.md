### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.
In Italian, there are only _prepositions_.

Adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _invece di_ "instead of", _a causa di_ "because of", _davanti a_ "in front of". The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_a_ is `ADP`, _causa_ is [NOUN](), _di_ is `ADP`) and their status as
multiword expressions is accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

Adpositions are also used for introducing non-finite clausal complements.

See [mwe]() for more on multi-word expressions.
