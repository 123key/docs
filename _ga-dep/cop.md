`cop` is used 

In Irish, there is a distinction between the substantive verb _bí_ `to be', which
inflects for tense, mood and person as per all Irish verbs -- and the copula _is_, which
only has two tensed forms - present/future and past/conditional.

Bí, as a verb, uses separate particles in negative and interrogative constructions. 
_Is_ (copula) uses its own forms in these constructions. For example: 

* ba (conditional/ past - positive)
* ar (past/ interrogative - positive)
* nach (present/ future - interrogative/ negative)
* ní (present/ future - negative)
 

The order of elements in a copula construction is in general: 
<b>copula</b>, <b>predicate</b> (new or focussed information), and <b>subject</b>
