# Features in UD v2

## Renaming existing features and/or values

## Adding new values to existing features

## Adding new features

`Abbr=Yes` (abbreviation) is not language specific and is currently used in 12 treebanks: ar, cs, cs_cac, cs_cltt, da, et, fi, fi_ftb, fo, la_ittb, pl, ro.

## Comparison with UniMorph

Ideally a mapping of the features that exist in both systems.

## Inventory of features that will stay language-specific

`AdpType` distinguishes prepositions from postpositions, but also a few other types. It is used in a number of treebanks, but the usage is not consistent and I have some doubts whether it is useful. Many languages have a strong preference towards either pre- or postpositions.
