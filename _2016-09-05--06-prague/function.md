# Function words in UD v2


## Auxiliaries

<!-- Is aux only used with verbs, or are other parts of speech permitted, too? The current guidelines (http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/aux_.html) just say "verbs". But the current data sometimes contain particles (Bulgarian) and maybe other categories as well. I think we have agreed that the infinitival particle "to/zu/att/..." should be mark and not aux, and it is in most of the treebanks (I fixed German a couple of days ago). But Bulgarian also includes a particle that marks the future tense, a function performed by auxiliary verbs in other languages. Is it allowed to be aux? -->

<!-- Joakim: In line with loosening the constraints between part-of-speech tags and syntactic relations, I donâ€™t see a problem with allowing other things than verbs to have the aux relation. Maybe we should should define aux as a grammaticalized expression of TMA categories? -->
