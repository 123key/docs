# Function words in UD v2

<!-- Background -->

## Copula constructions 

### Status quo

### Principle

* For copulas, we should be maximally restrictive with respect to which verbs can be copulas (only one verb in most languages) but maximally permissive when it comes to treating this verb as cop. Basically, the copula verb should never be the root, except through promotion (“he is not happy, but she is”). 
* We need to give more detailed guidelines for choosing the predicate in copula sentences when it is not one of the obvious cases (noun, adjective). Idea: use obliqueness hierarchy.
* We may want to add the subtype `nsubj:cop` to avoid having to flip dependencies when the predicate is a clause. It may also be used more generally to signal that the subject in copula constructions is special.
* The other functional relations are less problematic, but more detailed guidelines will be useful.

### Examples and recommendation

#### Simple predication

#### Adverbials, time and location

#### Existential constructions 

#### Idiomatic expressions
