# Coordination in UD v2

We suggest changeing the guidelines for coordination, following the proposal of Gerdes & Kahane (LAW 2016). We will attach cc and internal punct to the immediately succeeding conjunct (instead of to the first conjunct).


This will allow a better treatment of sentences headed by a conjunction, and will mesh better with our proposal for analyzing ellipsis.
