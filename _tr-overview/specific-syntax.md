# Specific constructions


## Noun compounds

Turkish noun compounds are generally classified into three classes:

1. **Bare compounds:** *tahta kapı* 'wooden door', 
   *kadın subay* 'woman army officer', 
   *İspanyol ressam* 'Spanish painter', 
   *Güniz Sokak* 'Güniz street'
2. **-(s)I compounds**, possessive marked head with bare complements:
   *otobüs bileti* 'bus ticket',
   *Tuz Gölü* 'Salt Lake',
   *Asya ülkesi* 'Asian country'.
3. **genitive-posssessive** construction:
   *arabanın motoru* 'engine of the car/car's engine',
   *babamın işi* 'my father's job',
   *Ali'nin arabası* 'Ali's car',
   *Benim arkadaşlarım* 'My friends'.

We link the first kind with `compound`, while the other two are linked
with `nmod:poss`.

Note that the compounds can be complex with arbitrary structure, as in
'[[İstanbul üniversites-i]-nin [tahta kapı]-sı]'.

Furthermore, the nominals can include subordinate clauses, like
*[Ali'nin henüz görmediği] film* 'the movie (that) Ali hasn't seen
yet'.

**We need more specific guidelines** for marking compounds with subordinate clauses.
