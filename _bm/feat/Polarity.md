### <a name="Neg">`Neg`</a>: negative

In Bambara, function words which are used to negate are marked with the `Polarity` feature. This typically applies to some [particles](bm-pos/PART) and [auxiliaries](bm-pos/AUX).


#### Example


* _na ma papa <b>no</b> get money_ "It is my father who does not have money"
* _de <b>not</b> rush you_ "They don't rush you"
* _we <b>neva</b> send our pikin go school_ "we haven't sent our child to school"


### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive


Positive polarity (affirmativeness) is rarely, encoded using overt morphology. Bambara uses it to distinguish response [interjections](bm-pos/INTJ) yes and no.

* _dem want come every day ? <b>yes</b>_ "Do they want to come every day ? Yes"
