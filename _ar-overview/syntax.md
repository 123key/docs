# Syntax

The syntactic annotation in the Arabic UD treebanks follows the general guidelines but adds three language-specific relations:

* _nmod:poss for possessive/genitive modifiers
* _flat:name for flat relations in proper nouns
* _nsubj:pass for nominal subjects of passive verbs

The syntactic annotation has been automatically converted from the original annotation schemes (the PADT for UD Arabic and PATB for UD Arabic LDC).
