# Executive Summary

This document summarizes the major changes from v1 to v2 of the universal guidelines.
The primary purpose is to provide a checklist for treebank developers who want to start the transition from v1 to v2.
More background and discussion can be found in the thematic reports on [v2](index.html), which we cross-reference below.
Complete documentation of the new guidelines will follow as quickly as possible.

## Word segmentation

* Allow words with spaces for languages where spaces mark something else than word boundaries (for example, syllable boundaries as in Vietnamese).
* Allow words with spaces (in any language) for an approved (and restricted) list of exceptions like numbers (“100 000”) and abbreviations (“i. e.”).

More discussion about word segmentation can be found [here](segmentation.html)

## Part-of-speech tags

* Rename the tag `CONJ` to `CCONJ`.
* Extend the use of `AUX` to copula verbs and nonverbal TAMVE particles.
