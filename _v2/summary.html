# Executive Summary

This document summarizes the major changes from v1 to v2 of the universal guidelines.
The primary purpose is to provide a checklist for treebank developers who want to start the transition from v1 to v2.
More background and discussion can be found in the thematic reports on [v2](index.html), which we cross-reference below.
Complete documentation of the new guidelines will follow as quickly as possible.

## Universal part-of-speech tags

1. Rename the tag `CONJ` to `CCONJ`
2. Extend the use of AUX to copula verbs and nonverbal TAMVE particles.

More discussion about part-of-speech tags can be found in [postags](postags.html)
