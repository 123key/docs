# Function Dependents in UD v2

Crosslinguistic guidelines for the use of the functional labels such as `aux`, `det`, `cop`.
There is currently a lot of variation around this.
Representing lexical heads promotes crosslinguistic parallelism, but only if we can agree on what lexical heads *are*.

## Copula

* Has been discussed in Uppsala 2015, see [http://universaldependencies.org/2015-08-23-uppsala/copula.html](http://universaldependencies.org/2015-08-23-uppsala/copula.html)
* The Uppsala solution has been criticized, and a change proposed in #329, see [https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/329](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/329)
