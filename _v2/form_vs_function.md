# Form vs. Function in UD v2: POS tags and Syntax

To what extent should the part-of-speech tag be
predictable from the syntactic relation and vice versa? For example, does “det” imply “DET” (rather than “PRON”)
or does “DET” imply “det” (or both or neither)? Coming up with a more consistent set of principles for making
these decisions will be important to achieve (better) cross-language consistency.
