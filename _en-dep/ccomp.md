A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause with an internal subject which functions like an object of the verb, or adjective.  Clausal complements for nouns are limited to complement clauses with a subset of nouns like *fact* or *report*.  We analyze them the same (parallel to the analysis of this class as "content clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Such clausal complements are usually finite (though there are occasional remnant English subjunctives).
