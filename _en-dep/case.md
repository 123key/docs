## `{{ page.title }}`: {{ page.shortdef }}

The `case` relation is used for any preposition. Prepositions are treated as dependents of the noun or clause they attach to or introduce. Thus, contrary to SD, UD abandons treating a preposition as a mediator between a modified word and its object. The `case` relation aims at providing a uniform analysis of prepositions and case in morphologically rich languages.
