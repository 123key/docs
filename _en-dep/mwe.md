## mwe : multi-word expression
The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is used for certain multi-word idioms that behave like a single function word.  It is used for a closed set of dependencies between words in common multi-word expressions for which it seems difficult or unclear to assign any other relationships.  At present, this relation is used inside the following expressions: *rather than, as well as, instead of, such as, because of, instead of, in addition to, all but, such as, because of, instead of, due to*.  The boundaries of this class are unclear; it could grow or shrink a little over time.

<div class="sd-parse">
He cried because of you
