## nn : noun compound modifier
A noun compound modifier of an NP is any noun that serves to modify the head noun. (Note that in the current system for dependency extraction, all nouns modify the rightmost noun of the NP -- there is no intelligent noun compound analysis.  This is likely to be fixed once the Penn Treebank represents the branching structure of NPs.)
