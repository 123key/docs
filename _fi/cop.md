## cop (copula)

Copular clauses receive a special treatment in the SD scheme. The predicative acts as the head word of the clause, and the copular verb depends on it using a `cop` (*copula*) dependency. The only copular verb in Finnish is *olla* \cite[\S 891]{isk}. Distinguishing copular structures from other constructs as well as recognizing the subject and the predicative is discussed in Section [copulas](#sec-copulas).
