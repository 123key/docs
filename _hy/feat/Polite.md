Politeness in Armenian belongs to the _speaker-referent
axis_ (meant to include the addressee when he happens to be the referent) and the honorific pronouns are used to refer to the addressee.

Note, that in Armenian, formal second person has the same form for singular and plural, and
is identical to informal second person plural. This involves both the pronoun
and the finite verb but not a participle, which has no special formal form. In addition, special pronouns are used
that only occur in the formal register (_Դուք_).

### <a name="Infm">`Infm`</a>: informal register

The informal register is usually meant for informal communication (e.g. with family
members and close friends).

Examples:

* _<b>դու գնացիր / դուք գնացիք</b>_ (you went.Sing/Plur)
* _<b>դու</b> գնում <b>ես / դուք</b> գնում <b>եք</b>_ (you go.Sing/Plur)

### <a name="Form">`Form`</a>: formal register

The polite register is usually meant for communication with strangers
and people of higher social status than the one of the speaker.

Examples:

* _<b>Դուք գնացիք</b>_ (you went.Sing/Plur)
* _<b>Դուք</b> գնում <b>եք</b>_ (you go.Sing/Plur)
