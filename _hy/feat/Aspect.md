Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc. In Armenian some tenses are actually combinations of tense and aspect. 

Note, that some aspectual meanings in compound tenses may be expressed at participles.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազում</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”,
* _<b>վազում</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազեցի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “I ran home”
* _<b>վազել</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”
* _<b>վազել</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”
* _<b>նստած </b> եմ տանը&nbsp;_ “to bake”
* _<b>նստած </b> էի տանը&nbsp;_ “to bake”

### <a name="Prosp">`Prosp`</a>: prospective aspect

In general, prospective aspect can be described as relative future:
the action is/was/will be expected to take place at a moment that
follows the reference point; the reference point itself can be
in past, present or future.

In some contexts subjunctive and conditional forms may also indicate prospective aspect and signal an event that expected to take place. `Prosp` meaning prevails in conditional imperfect forms.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազելու</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”,
* _<b>վազելու</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”,
* _<b>վազեմ</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”,
* _<b>վազեի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”
* _<b>կվազեմ</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”,
* _<b>կվազեի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “to bake”

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative / frequentative aspect

Denotes repeated action, with multiplicative or distributive meanings. Armenian has three main iterative markers _-ատ&nbsp;, -ոտ&nbsp;, -տ&nbsp;_ or reduplication.

Note, that in Armenian iterative is considered as a lexical feature of [verbs](VERB), thus they have morphologically related not iterative counterparts, and the two verbs are represented by different lemmas.

#### Examples

* _ցատկել&nbsp;_ “hit”, _<b>ցատկոտել</b>&nbsp;_ “hit several times”,
* _կտրել&nbsp;_ “hit”, _<b>կտրատել</b>&nbsp;_ “hit several times”,
* _փնտրել&nbsp;_ “hit”, _<b>փնտրտել</b>&nbsp;_ “hit several times”,
* _վազել&nbsp;_ “to run”, _<b>վազվզել</b>&nbsp;_ “to run around, to run often”

### <a name="Dur">`Dur`</a>: durative aspect

A situation or action that has persisted over a period of time and still continues. This is called durative action. 
The suffixes -Akal, -Agel and -Adur indicate this aspect (the first one might better be defined as ‘durative stative’ and others ‘durative progressive’).

#### Examples


- Durative / habitual aspect. The finite form of _լինեմ&nbsp;_ (in various tenses and moods or in the infinitive _լինել&nbsp;_) is combined with processual, resultative and future participles of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person, number, mood, tense and aspect, participles expresse tense / aspect and voice:
  _գնալու <b>լինեմ</b>&nbsp;_ “(If / when) I go.`Sub`”,
  _գնացած <b>լինեմ</b>&nbsp;_ “(If / when) I will be gone.`Sub`”,
  _գնալիս <b>լինեմ</b>&nbsp;_ “(If / when) I will be going.`Sub`”,
  _գնալու <b>լինել</b>&nbsp;_ “to intend to go, to be going”,
  _գնացած <b>լինել</b>&nbsp;_ “to be gone”,
  _գնալիս <b>լինել</b>&nbsp;_ “to be in the process of going”.
