In Armenian animacy is a lexical feature of [nouns](NOUN)  and inflectional feature of some [pronouns](PRON).

Armenian distinguishes three values, human vs. (non-human) animate vs. inanimate: nouns that are human and inflected as `Hum` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Dat](Case)); nouns that are animate or inanimate and inflected as `Anim` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Dat](Case)); nouns that are human, animate or inanimate and inflected as `Inan` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Nom/Acc](Case)).

Note that some school grammars of Armenian distinguish between `Hum` vs. `Nhum` or `Anim` vs. `Inan` features of nouns.

### <a name="Anim">`Anim`</a>: animate

Animals, fictional characters, names of professions etc. are all animate. Even nouns that are normally inanimate can be inflected as animate if they are personified. For instance, consider a children's story about cars where cars live and talk as people; then the cars may become and be inflected as animates. 

- _ձի_ “horse”, _եղնիկ_ “deer”, _աղավնի_ “pigeon”

### <a name="Inan">`Inan`</a>: inanimate

Nouns that are not animate are inanimate.

- _տարի_ “year”, _օրենք_ “law”, _պետություն_ “state”, _լեռ_ “mountain”, _ծառ_ “tree”

### <a name="Hum">`Hum`</a>: human

A subset of animates that only includes human beings (and names of professions etc.) but not animals.

- _մարդ_ “man”, _նախարար_ “minister”, _նախագահ_ “president”, _տնօրեն_ “director”, _ճարտարապետ_ “architect”
