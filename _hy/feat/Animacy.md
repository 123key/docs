In Armenian animacy is a lexical feature of [nouns](NOUN). Armenian distinguishes three values, human vs. non-human animate vs. inanimate:

See also the related feature of [Definite]().

Note that some school grammars of Armenian distinguish between lexical `Hum` vs. `Nhum` or `Anim` vs. `Inan` features of nouns.

There is antother classifaction:
- nouns that are human and inflected as `Hum` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Dat](Case)),
- nouns that are animate or inanimate and inflected as `Anim` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Dat](Case)),
- nouns that are human, animate or inanimate and inflected as `Inan` (as [obj](hy-dep/obj) in [Nom/Acc](Case)).

### <a name="Inan">`Inan`</a>: inanimate

Nouns that are not animate are inanimate. Even nouns that are normally inanimate can be inflected as animate if they are personified. For instance, consider a children's story about cars where cars live and talk as people; then the cars may become and be inflected as humans.

- _տարի_ “year”, _օրենք_ “law”, _պետություն_ “state”, _լեռ_ “mountain”, _ծառ_ “tree”

### <a name="Hum">`Hum`</a>: human

Human beings, fictional characters, names of professions etc. but not animals are all humans.

- _մարդ_ “man”, _երեխա_ “child”, _աղջիկ_ “girl”, _ամուսին_ “husband”, _ուսուցիչ_ “teacher”, _նախագահ_ “president”, _տնօրեն_ “director”

### <a name="Nhum">`Nhum`</a>: non-human

This value is used only for non-human animates (only animals).

- _ձի_ “horse”, _կով_ “cow”, _առյուծ_ “lion”, _արագիլ_ “stork”, _ձուկ_ “fish”
