We treat localizers (traditionally called “improper adpositions”) as postpositions which typically denote spatial locations, although a few localizers have further grammaticalized functions denoting temporal and other non-spatial concepts. (See [ADP]() for a list of localizers.) The head of the localizer is the noun or the main verb of the clause preceding it. Localizers are always tagged ADP (adposition). When it follows a noun, it receives the `case:loc` relation label.
