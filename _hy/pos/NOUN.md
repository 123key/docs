### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Armenian nouns have lexical feature [Animacy](). Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [Case](), [Definite](), [Number](), [PossNumber]() and [PossPerson]().

Note that _infinitives_ in Armenian share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or `NOUN` (e.g. _վազել_&nbsp; “to run” and _վազել(ը)_&nbsp; “running”). They have full case and reduced number inflectional paradigms.

### Examples

- _աղջիկ_&nbsp; “girl”
- _կատու_&nbsp; “cat”
- _ծառ_&nbsp; “tree”
- _օդ_&nbsp; “air”
- _գեղեցկություն_&nbsp; “beauty”
- _լող_&nbsp; “swimming”
- _վազք_&nbsp; “run”
- _վազել(ը)_&nbsp; “running”
