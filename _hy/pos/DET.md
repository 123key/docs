### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc.

Determiners under this definition include both _articles_ and _pro-adjectives (pronominal adjectives)_. An important point to note is that the traditional grammar of Armenian does not define determiners as a separate word class. Most determiners are traditionally called pronouns; that is, an UD-conformant annotation of Armenian must distinguish between substantive pronouns (UD tag [PRON]()) and attributive pronouns (UD tag `DET`).

Also note that the `DET` tag includes (pronominal) _quantifiers_ (words
like _քանի, այսքան, մի քանի, բոլոր, ողջ&nbsp;_ “how many, this many, several, all, whole”), which the traditional grammar classifies
as a special subclass of [pronouns](PRON).

Note that an Armenian nominal usually allows one `DET` modifier, but there are occasional cases of _addeterminers_, which appear outside the usual determiner, such as _այս_ in _<b>այս</b> բոլոր հարցերը&nbsp;_ “all <b>these</b> questions.” In such cases, both _այս&nbsp;_ “these” and _բոլոր&nbsp;_ “all” are given the POS `DET`.

### Examples

- possessive determiners: _իմ, քո, նրա, մեր, ձեր, նրանց, իրենց&nbsp;_ “my, your, his/her/its, our, your, their”
- reflexive possessive determiner: _իր, իրենց&nbsp;_ “one's own, themselves”
