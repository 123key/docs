### Definition

Armenian has prepositions and postpositions but no circumpositions. They occur before or after complement noun phrase (noun, pronoun) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some prepositions take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g. _ի սեր&nbsp;_ “for the love of”, _ի պատիվ&nbsp;_ “in honor of”. The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (_ի&nbsp;_ is [ADP](), _սեր&nbsp;_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

Note, that a closed set of adpositions (a group reffering to location) in Armenian inflect for [Case](), [PossNumber]() and [PossPerson](). Examples include, _մոտ, մոտ<b>ից</b>, մոտ<b>ով</b>, մոտ<b>ս</b>, մոտ<b>ներս</b>&nbsp;_ “at, from, by, at me, at us”, _վրա, վրայ<b>ից</b>, վրայ<b>ով</b>&nbsp;_ “on, from off, over”, _մեջ, միջ<b>ից</b>, միջ<b>ով</b>&nbsp;_ “in, out of, through”, _տակ, տակ<b>ից</b>, տակ<b>ով</b>&nbsp;_ “under, from, under”.

Note also, that there is a number of postpositions, derived from a closed set of nouns, e.g. _հասցե<b>ին</b>&nbsp;_ “about”, _նպատակ<b>ով</b>&nbsp;_ “in odrer to”, _միջոց<b>ով</b>&nbsp;_ “by means of”, _կողմ<b>ից</b>&nbsp;_ “from the side of”.

We mark these expressions as `ADP` when they are used as postpositions.
