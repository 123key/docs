### Definition

The only truly auxiliary verb in Armenian is _է_ “to be”,
and its variant (with separate lemma) _լինեմ (լինել)_ “to be habitually”.
It accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses
grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb.

The dependency label indicates their use (auxiliary, copula or content verb).

Armenian auxiliary verbs can be divided into:

- tense auxiliaries (`Past` and `Pres`), used to form compound tenses represented by _եմ_ and _էի_ “to be”;
- aspectual auxiliaries, used to form so-called “secondary compound tenses” represented by _լինեմ (լինել)_ “to be habitually”.

### Examples

### Modal verbs are not auxiliaries

Armenian modal verbs are not considered auxiliary and they are tagged `VERB`. Their behavior is only slightly different from other content verbs.
