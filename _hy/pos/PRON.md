### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that
Armenian grammar traditionally extends the term _pronoun_ to words that
substitute for [adjectives](ADJ). Such words are not tagged `PRON`
under our universal scheme. They are tagged as [determiners](DET) in
order to annotate the same thing same way across languages.

For instance, _այդ&nbsp;_ “that” is traditionally called pronoun in
Armenian grammar, regardless of context (for the notion of determiners in some Armenian grammars, a term exists like _adjective-pronoun_ or _pronoun-adjective_).
To make the annotation parallel across languages, it should be now tagged `PRON` in _<b>Այդ</b> քո մեքենա՞ն է։&nbsp;_ “Is <b>that</b> your car?” and `DET` in _Ես <b>այդ</b> մեքենան երեկ եմ տեսել։&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>that</b> car yesterday.”

### Examples

- personal pronouns: _já, ty, on, ona, ono, my, vy, oni, ony&nbsp;_ “I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they, they”
- reflexive pronouns: _sebe, se, sobě, si, sebou&nbsp;_ “oneself”
- interrogative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _<b>Co</b> si myslíš?&nbsp;_ “<b>What</b> do you think?”
- relative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _Zajímalo by mě, <b>co</b> si myslíš.&nbsp;_  “I wonder <b>what</b> you think.”
- indefinite pronouns: _někdo, něco&nbsp;_ “somebody, something”
- negative pronouns: _nikdo, nic&nbsp;_ “nobody, nothing”
