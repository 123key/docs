## ccomp : clausal complement

A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause with
an internal subject which functions like an object of the verb, or
adjective.  Clausal complements for nouns are limited to complement
clauses with a subset of nouns like "fact" or "report".  We analyze
them the same (parallel to the analysis of this class as "content
clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Such clausal complements are
usually finite (though there are occasional remnant English
subjunctives).

<div class="sd-parse">
