# Introduction

The Estonian UD treebank is taken from [HamleDT 3.0](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/hamledt) and
slightly modified (there are minor improvements in the conversion procedure). HamleDT in turn
took the data from the website of the
[Eesti keele puudepank](http://kodu.ut.ee/~kaili/Korpus/puud/).

This corpus is also called Arborest and it is an experimental VISL-style hybrid treebank.
It resulted from experiments on creating an Estonian treebank semiautomatically
from a sample of the Estonian text corpus, annotated (parsed and manually corrected)
on the shallow-syntactic level. The annotation was based on the Constraint Grammar.

An experimental phrase structure grammar module was then written by Eckhard Bick
with the help from Heli Uibo and Kadri Muischnek,
generating VISL-style phrase structure from CG-annotated text.
149 trees were examined visually, using the Slanttree Treebank viewer 4,
developed in the VISL project.

The experimental VISL-style Estonian Treebank can be searched at
[http://corp.hum.sdu.dk/arborest.html]()
and downloaded from
[http://kodu.ut.ee/~kaili/Korpus/puud/]().
It is a rather small treebank, consisting of 1315 sentences (9491 tokens).

A new Estonian Dependency Treebank is being prepared at the University of Tartu but it is not
available yet.

## Acknowledgments

We wish to thank the authors of the Arborest treebank for their effort and for making the
data available to the research community.
