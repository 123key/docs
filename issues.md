## Issues to resolve at the Uppsala meeting

This is a list of selected issues that need more discussion and may lead to future modifications of the UD standard.
It does not replace the Github <a href="https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/issues>Issue Tracker</a>.
It is rather a subset of open issues from the issue tracker, with main points emphasized here.
The relevant issues in the issue tracker should be referenced from here; comments and on-line discussion should
remain there.

* Multi-word abbreviations ([#181]()) <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/181">181</a>.
  Some treebanks may split them to syntactic words? Others keep them together.
  The issue is also related to how different treebanks tokenize abbreviations and their punctuation.
