The `conj:coord` relation is used between conjuncts that are coordinated. Coordinating conjunctions such as _et_ (_and_) or _ou_ (_or_) may connect the conjuncts, but they are not necessary. 
Conjunctions are treated asymetrically with the first conjunct as the head, and all the other conjuncts as dependants of this element.
