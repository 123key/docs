### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [sv] _de <b>kompletterar</b> varandra_ "they <b>complement</b> eachother"
* [sv] _vi <b>behöver</b>_ "we <b>need</b>"

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>låt</b> oss_ "<b>let</b> us"
* [sv] _<b>jämför</b> dem_ "<b>compare</b> them"

### `Sub`: subjunctive / conjunctive

In modern Swedish the subjunctive is mainly used in certain fixed expressions and as a conditional form. It is also occassionally used in the more traditional sense, expressing actions that are subjective or otherwise uncertain in subordinate clauses.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>Leve</b> Sverige!_ "Long <b>live</b> Sweden!"
* [sv] _det <b>vore</b> önskvärt_ "it <b>would be</b> desirable"
* [sv] _som om jag <b>vore</b> försumlig_ "as if I <b>were</b> neglectful"
