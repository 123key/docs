Pronominal type is a feature of (some) pronouns, determiners and pronominal adverbs in Swedish. Currently, we only use the `Int` and `Rel` values and do not disambiguate between them.

### `Int`: interrogative pronoun, determiner, or adverb

#### Examples: 

* Pronouns: _vem_ "who", _vad_ "what"
* Determiners: _vilken_ (common singular) "which", _vilket_ (neuter singular) "which", _vilka_ (plural) "which"
* Adverbs: _när_ "when", _var_ "where", _hur_ "how"

### `Rel`: relative pronoun, determiner, or adverb


* Pronouns: _som_ "that", _vilken_ "who"
* Determiners: _vars_, _vilkens_ "whose"
* Adverbs: _då_ "when", _där_ "where"


* [cs] _jenž, což_ "which", "that" (relative but not interrogative
  pronouns); _jehož_ "whose" (possessive relative pronoun)
