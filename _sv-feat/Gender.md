Gender is a lexical feature of nouns and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech (adjectives, determiners) that mark agreement with
nouns. 

### `Com`: common gender

Swedish does not distinguish masculine/feminine most of the time but does distinguish neuter vs. non-neuter (neutrum/utrum). The non-neuter is called common gender.

#### Examples

* [sv] _en ogift mor_ "an unmarried mother"
* [sv] _<b>anmälan</b> blir <b>ifylld</b>_ "the <b>report</b> is <b>filled</b> in"

### `Neut`: neuter gender

Nouns and other parts-of-speech that are neither masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

#### Examples

* [sv] _fullt bostadstillägg_ "full housing supplement"
* [sv] _<b>det</b> första <b>kravet</b>_ "<b>the</b> first <b>requirement</b>"

### `Masc`: masculine gender

Some adjectives, when referring specifically to a male person, take a masculine form in Swedish.

#### Examples

* [sv] _den arbetslöse_ "the unemployed (man)"
* [sv] _den <b>brittiske</b> författaren_ "the <b>British</b> author"
