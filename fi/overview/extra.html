<p>This page contains material from the TDT guidelines that has not yet
been incorporated into the primary UD Finnish documentation. The
following should <em>not</em> be considered part of the UD Finnish
guidelines.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rel-relativizer">2.44 rel (relativizer)</h2>

<p>(The following section was lifted from the TDT documentation for
<code>rel</code>, which is removed in UD Finnish. See
<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/73">https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/73</a> for more
information.)</p>

<p>In TDT, the <em>relativizer</em> (<code>rel</code>) is the head of the phrase containing
the relative pronoun (or other relative word). Most often, but not
always, this is the relative word itself. The governor of the
dependency is the main predicate of the relative clause.</p>

<p>For UD Finnish, relative markers are be mapped to the syntactic role
that the relative is playing in the relative clause, such as <code>nsubj</code>
or <code>dobj</code>. This information is present in the second annotation layer
of the TDT corpus.</p>

<!-- TODO Annotation of relative clauses is more closely examined in Section [relclauses](#sec-relclauses). -->

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this is TDT example using <code>rel</code>, not a UD Finnish example.</p>

<h2 id="the-null-token">2.47 The null token</h2>

<p>The <em>null token</em> is not a dependency type, but an extra token that is
added into the sentence to represent a missing token. A null token is
only added when the missing token is required in order to construct an
analysis, that is, when it governs another token that is present in
the sentence. Thus, for instance copulas and auxiliaries are not
represented by null tokens when absent, because if they are absent,
their dependents are as well. The null token is most commonly, but not
always, a verb.</p>

<p>There are two basic uses for the null token in TDT. First, it is used
in <em>fragments</em>: sentences or clauses with an omitted main predicate.</p>

<!-- fname:null_fragment.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Presidentti *null* Kiinaan solmimaan sopimusta . \n The_president *null* to_China to_make a_deal .

nommod(*null*-2, Kiinaan-3)
xcomp(*null*-2, solmimaan-4)
dobj(solmimaan-4, sopimusta-5)
punct(*null*-2, .-6)
</code></pre>

<p>Second, the null token is used in <em>gapping</em>, a type of <em>ellipsis</em>
where a head word has been omitted to avoid repetition. Gapping is the
only type of ellipsis marked with null tokens, as according to the
definition of a null token, only words required for constructing an
analysis should be represented by one.</p>

<!-- fname:null_ellipsis.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Matti tilasi jäätelön ja Pekka *null* leivoksen . \n Matti ordered ice_cream and Pekka *null* cake .

</code></pre>

<h1 id="conjunct-propagation-and-additional-dependencies">3 Conjunct propagation and additional dependencies</h1>

<p>This section describes four phenomena that are annotated in the second
annotation layer of TDT, termed the <em>conjunct propagation and
additional dependencies</em> layer. These phenomena are <em>the propagation
of conjunct dependencies</em>, <em>external subjects</em>, <em>syntactic functions
of relativizers</em> and <em>gapping</em>. The annotation of this layer is added
on top of the first layer, meaning that the analyses are no longer
trees.</p>

<h2 id="conjunct-propagation">3.1 Conjunct propagation</h2>

<p>The SD scheme analyzes coordinations so that the first coordinated
element is the head of the whole coordination.</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE MISSING</strong></p>

<p>In this analysis alone, it is not possible to distinguish dependents
and governors of the first coordinated element from those of the whole
coordination, nor from elements that depend on or govern some but not
all conjuncts. Therefore in the extended variants of the SD scheme,
this distinction is made explicit with additional dependencies on top
of the tree structure. That is, if an element modifies or governs
multiple coordinated elements, it should be <em>propagated</em> to them. In
principle, any dependency type introduced in Sections 2 and 3, with
the exceptions of <code>punct</code>, <code>conj</code>, <code>cc</code> and <code>ellipsis</code>, can propagate
in the second layer of annotation. Note especially that the
dependencies introduced in the second layer, that is, external
subjects and syntactic functions of relativizers, are also allowed to
propagate.</p>

<!-- fname:propagation.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Tultuaan kotiin Maija söi ensin lounaan ja imuroi sitten . \n After_coming home Maija ate first lunch and hoovered then .

nsubj(söi-4, Maija-3)

punct(söi-4, .-10)
advcl(imuroi-8, Tultuaan-1)
nsubj(imuroi-8, Maija-3)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to simply propagating to other coordinated elements, it is
possible for a dependency to change its type while doing so. This may
happen in coordinations of elements with differing parts-of-speech,
and cases where a sentence element acts in one syntactic role for the
first conjunct and in an another role for some other conjunct.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2 id="external-subjects-xsubj">3.2 External subjects (xsubj)</h2>

<p>Open clausal complements, as discussed in Section 2.46, share their
subject with another verb. The fact that the subject of the main verb
is also the subject of the complement cannot be annotated on the first
layer of TDT, as this would violate the treeness restriction.
Therefore, these subjects are marked on the second layer of annotation
using the dependency types <code>xsubj</code> (<em>external subject</em>) and
<code>xsubj-cop</code> (<em>external copular subject</em>). Note also that an open
clausal complement may not always have a subject, in for instance
passive constructions.</p>

<!-- fname:xsubj.pdf -->

xsubj(lukemaan-3, Matti-1)
</code></pre>

<p>External subjects interact with conjunct propagation in two ways: an
external subject may propagate, and also a propagated <code>nsubj</code>
dependency may be the source of a new <code>xsubj</code> dependency.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2 id="syntactic-functions-of-relativizers">3.3 Syntactic functions of relativizers</h2>

<p>Relativizers, that is, the phrases containing the relative word are
marked as such in the base layer of annotation, using the dependency
type <code>rel</code> (see Section 2.44).  However, the relativizers also always
have a secondary syntactic function, such as a subject, which cannot
be marked on the base layer of annotation due to the treeness
restriction. Therefore these functions are marked on the <em>conjunct
propagation and additional dependencies</em> layer on top of the tree
structure. In principle any dependency type from Section 2 may
represent the syntactic function of a relativizer, although in
practice certain types (such as <code>punct</code>) will not do so.</p>

<!-- fname:rel_secondary.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Auto , joka ohitti meidät , ajoi hyvin nopeasti . \n The_car , which passed us , drove very fast .
nsubj(ajoi-7, Auto-1)
punct(ajoi-7, .-10)
advmod(ajoi-7, nopeasti-9)
advmod(nopeasti-9, hyvin-8)

punct(ohitti-4, ,-2)
punct(ohitti-4, ,-6)
rel(ohitti-4, joka-3)
nsubj(ohitti-4, joka-3)
</code></pre>

<p>Relativizers and their secondary functions may propagate in
coordinations, and if the dependencies are between the same tokens
(see Section 5.6 for discussion of cases where they are not), they
will propagate together.</p>

<!-- fname:rel_propagation.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Mies , joka puhui ja puhui , oli serkkuni . \n The_man , who talked and talked , was my_cousin .

conj(puhui-4, puhui-6)
nsubj(puhui-4, joka-3)
rel(puhui-6, joka-3)
nsubj(puhui-6, joka-3)
</code></pre>

<p>If the syntactic function of a relativizer is a subject, the
relativizer may also act as an external subject to another verb.</p>

<!-- fname:rel_xsubj.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">mies , joka ryhtyi laulamaan \n the_man , who started_to sing

xcomp(ryhtyi-4, laulamaan-5)
nsubj(ryhtyi-4, joka-3)
xsubj(laulamaan-5, joka-3)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="gapping-ellipsis-of-a-head-word">3.4 Gapping (ellipsis of a head word)</h2>

<p>As described in Section 2.47, gapping in TDT is marked by inserting a
so called null token to represent the omitted token. In addition, the
second layer annotation uses the dependency type <code>ellipsis</code> to mark
the elided word so that the null token acts as the dependent, and the
governor is the non-elided occurrence of the word (Note that the
elided word can also precede the non-elided occurrence).</p>

<p>Note that according to the policy of only inserting a null token where
necessary for constructing an analysis (see Section 2.47), gapping
is the only form of ellipsis marked using null tokens and <code>ellipsis</code>
dependencies in TDT. Some other elliptical structures may be less
explicitly marked as <em>conjunct propagation</em> (see Section 3.1).</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE MISSING</strong></p>

<h1 id="differences-between-the-finnish-and-english-versions-of-the-sd-scheme">4 Differences between the Finnish and English versions of the SD scheme</h1>

<p>The original SD scheme by de Marneffe and Manning includes in total 55
dependency types arranged in a hierarchy; excluding six intermediate
types that are not meant to be used if a more specific type can be
selected, the total number of dependency types is 49. The
Finnish-specific scheme version used in this work includes 46
dependency types in the base layer and 3 additional types in the
conjunct propagation and additional dependencies layer. This section
discusses the differences between the two scheme versions. Figure 1
shows the original SD type hierarchy as described in the SD scheme
manual, and Figure 2 the hierarchy of the Finnish-specific version.</p>

<p>To maintain a hierarchy similar to the original one, Figure 2 includes
four intermediate types which have not been introduced above and are
not used in TDT: <code>arg</code> (argument), <code>comp</code> (complement), <code>subj</code>
(subject) and <code>mod</code> (modifier). This makes the overall number of types
in the Finnish SD scheme 53.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-types-not-used-in-finnish-specific-sd">4.1 Dependency types not used in Finnish-specific SD</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why the Finnish-specific SD scheme differs
from the original scheme. First, some dependency types from the
original scheme have been removed, as the corresponding phenomenon
does not occur in Finnish. Types omitted for this reason include
<code>expl</code> (expletive there), <code>csubjpass</code> (clausal passive subject),
<code>nsubjpass</code> (nominal passive subject), <code>agent</code>, <code>possessive</code> (the
possessive ’s) and <code>iobj</code> (indirect object). Finnish existential
clauses do not contain an expletive there, nor do passive clauses have
a subject. What in English is considered the passive subject is the
direct object in Finnish, and thus the corresponding type, <code>dobj</code> is
used instead, or in the case of a clause acting as the direct object,
it is marked as a clausal complement (<code>ccomp</code>). Similarly, there are
no agents in Finnish passive clauses, and constructions resembling the
English agent can be analyzed according to their syntactic structure
rather than semantically as agents. This makes the type <code>agent</code>
unnecessary. Also the possessive ’s does not occur in Finnish, and
thus the dependency type <code>possessive</code> is not needed. Finally, indirect
objects do not occur in Finnish, as regardless of word order, the
corresponding argument is expressed by a nominal modifier.</p>

<p>Second, adpositional phrases are handled differently from the original
SD scheme, so as to analyze them similarly to nominal modifiers without
a pre- or postposition present. Thus, the original SD types <code>prep</code> and
<code>pobj</code> are not used.  Third, the type <code>ref</code> (<em>referent</em>) is not
included in the current TDT annotation. When used, it causes the
structures to not be trees, meaning that it would be part of an
additional layer of annotation.</p>

<p>Fourth, three dependency types are considered semantic in nature, and
thus not included in the first layer of annotation in TDT. These types
include <code>purpcl</code> (purpose clause), <code>tmod</code> (temporal modifier) and
<code>measure</code>. Instead of using these semantic types, the dependency types
appropriate for the syntactic structure of each phenomenon are used in
TDT. Finally, no distinction between apposition-like abbreviations
(<code>abbrev</code>) (such as <em>United States of America (USA)</em>) and appositions
(<code>appos</code>) is made, meaning both dependency types have been merged
under the appos type, and instead of marking predicatives in some
situations as attributives (<code>attr</code>), they are always analyzed as
predicatives.</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE 1 OMITTED</strong></p>

<p><strong>FIGURE 2 OMITTED</strong></p>

<h2 id="new-dependency-types-in-finnish-specific-sd">4.2 New dependency types in Finnish-specific SD</h2>

<p>In addition to types not used in the Finnish-specific SD scheme, there
are also dependency types that are new to this scheme version. First,
two new dependency types were needed to accommodate the similar
handling of nominal modifiers and adpositional phrases: <code>nommod</code> and
<code>adpos</code>, both under the <code>modifier</code> subcategory.  It should be noted
that although <code>nommod</code> is considered a modifier type, many nominal
modifiers in the treebank are at least borderline complements, due to
the fact that many Finnish verbs take inflected nominals as their
arguments.</p>

<p>Second, the dependency types <code>gsubj</code> and <code>gobj</code> were also added under
the <code>modifier</code> subcategory, to accommodate the frequent constructions
of nouns that take a subject- or object-like argument. The genitive
subject and object take the form of a genitive modifier, and thus they
are direct subtypes of <code>poss</code>.</p>

<p>Third, under the <code>subject</code> category, both the nominal and clausal
subject types have received a new subtype, <code>nsubj-cop</code> and
<code>csubj-cop</code>, respectively, to be used for subjects of copular clauses,
which have their own special treatment in the SD scheme. These two new
types come in place of the passive subject types that were, as
explained above, removed as unnecessary. Also we have moved the
existing <code>xsubj</code> type from under the <code>sdep</code> category to under the
<code>subject</code> category, and added a new subtype for <code>xsubj</code>, <code>xsubj-cop</code>.
The external subject types are part of the <em>conjunct propagation and
additional dependencies</em> layer of the treebank.</p>

<p>Fourth, in the <code>complement</code> category, we have introduced one new
subtype for clausal complements (<code>ccomp</code>): that of <em>infinite clausal
complement</em>, <code>iccomp</code>. This is due to the fact that clausal
complements in Finnish often involve an infinite main verb.</p>

<p>Fifth, we have added five other new dependency types. The types
<code>compar</code> and <code>comparator</code> are to be used in structures involving
comparisons of adjectives (and occasionally other parts-of-speech).
The type <code>voc</code> is introduced to be able to analyze <em>vocatives</em>, and
the type <code>intj</code> is for <em>interjections</em>. The treebank contains only
written Finnish, but both vocatives and interjections are fairly
common in more informal genres, such as blog text.  The type
<code>ellipsis</code> is part of the <em>conjunct propagation and additional
dependencies</em> layer and used to mark the elided word in gapping.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchy-changes">4.3 Hierarchy changes</h2>

<p>Finally, there are two minor changes made in the SD hierarchy. First,
as prepositional objects are no longer needed in the Finnish-specific
scheme due to the changes made to handling adpositional phrases, and
as indirect objects do not occur in Finnish, the type <code>dobj</code> was the
sole subtype of the intermediate, unused type <code>obj</code>, we have removed
this intermediate type, and made <code>dobj</code> a direct subtype of
<code>complement</code>.</p>

<p>Second, the <code>neg</code> dependency type, for marking negations, has been
moved from under adverbial modifiers to under auxiliaries in the
hierarchy. This is because in Finnish, the negation word ei is in most
contexts a verb and acts in an auxiliary-like manner. It should be
noted, however, that in TDT there are few cases where it is considered
that for instance a noun phrase has been negated or where <em>ei</em>
functions as the counterpart of <em>kyllä</em> “yes”, and is thus an adverb.</p>

<h1 id="annotating-phenomena-of-finnish">Annotating phenomena of Finnish</h1>

<p>This section gives detailed instructions on annotating certain common
phenomena that require detailed decision rules.</p>

<h2 id="subjects-and-objects">5.1 Subjects and objects</h2>

<p>Both subjects and objects are straightforward to recognize in their
prototypical cases, but both phenomena also have some difficult cases,
which are discussed here.</p>

<p>The subject is the primary complement of the verb, usually denoting
the entity doing something. In addition to the <em>basic subject</em> (see
[ISK §910]), also <em>existential subjects</em> (eksistentiaalisubjekti,
e-subjekti) are considered subjects in TDT.</p>

<!-- fname:nsubj_existential.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Tien vieressä on talo . \n Road beside is house .
adpos(Tien-1, vieressä-2)
nommod(on-3, Tien-1)
nsubj(on-3, talo-4)
punct(on-3, .-5)
</code></pre>

<p>Possessive clauses (omistuslause) are considered a subtype of
existential clauses, and analyzed similarly. As explained in Section
2.31, the owner in possessive clauses is marked using the type
<code>nommod-own</code>.</p>

<!-- fname:nsubj_possessive.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Hänellä on oma asunto . \n At_him is own apartment .
nommod-own(on-2, Hänellä-1)
nsubj(on-2, asunto-4)
amod(asunto-4, oma-3)
punct(on-2, .-5)
</code></pre>

<p>Also the genitive subject (not to be confused with the genitive
subject of a noun, discussed in Section 2.22) in for instance
necessive structures (see Section 5.14) is annotated as an <code>nsubj</code>.</p>

<!-- fname:nsubj_necessive.pdf -->
<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Minun on pakko mennä kotiin . \n I(gen.) is obligation go home .
nsubj(mennä-4, Minun-1)
cop(pakko-3, on-2)
iccomp(pakko-3, mennä-4)
nommod(mennä-4, kotiin-5)
punct(pakko-3, .-6)
</code></pre>

<p>In TDT, subjects are allowed to be in the <em>nominative</em>, <em>genitive</em> and
<em>partitive</em> cases, and in addition, also an <em>accusative</em> subject is
possible (the accusative case only exists for certain pronouns). Two
notable situations where a complement in the accusative form is
analyzed as the subject are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite clausal complements (<em>Sain hänet itkemään.</em> “I made him
cry.”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possessive clauses (<em>Minulla on sinut.</em> “I have you.”)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The same cases are allowed for objects as for subjects: the
nominative, the partitive, the genitive and the
accusative. Complements in other cases are analyzed as <em>nominal
modifiers</em> (<code>nommod</code>), despite their complement status.</p>

<p><em>Object cased amount adverbials</em> (objektin sijainen määrän
adverbiaali, OSMA [ISK, §972]), which, as the name implies, use the
same cases as objects, are analyzed as nominal modifiers. However,
certain verbs are considered such that they can take as their object
an expression that would otherwise be considered an amount adverbial.
Examples where an amount is considered the object are for instance:</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>Juoksin kilometrin.</em> “I ran a kilometer.”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>Moottori pyöri kymmenen kierrosta.</em> “The motor ran ten rounds.”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>Maitotölkki painaa kilon.</em> “A milk jar weighs a kilogram.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Passive verbforms take a direct object and not a passive subject, as
in for instance English.</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE MISSING</strong></p>

<p>However, there are certain verbs, so called <em>derived passives</em> [ISK,
§336], which may resemble passive verbforms in meaning, but which in
fact take a subject, not an object. (In English, the Finnish derived
passives generally correspond to intransitive uses of a verb, such as
<em>the door opens</em>, sometimes termed <em>inchoative</em>.).</p>
