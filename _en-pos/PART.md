The following English words (only) are currently being treated as `PART` in English:

* Possessive marker: _’s_ or _’_ (and non-standard form _s_, _-s_)
* Predicate negation: _not_, _n’t_, _nt_
* Infinitive marker: _to_ (and non-standard forms _ta_, _na_, _too_, _ot_, _2_, _a_)

(This is a slightly motley list and we may still want to rethink this category for English....)
