# Uppsala Group on Ellipsis

_(Arne Skj√¶rholt, Chris Manning, Dan Zeman, Verginica Mititelu)_

Ellipsis is a fairly universal phenomenon, yet it is admittedly underspecified in the Universal
Dependencies guidelines. It should be documented in the
[Specific constructions](../u/overview/specific-syntax.html#ellipsis) section of each language
because it affects many different relations. As of today, there is a section on this topic in the
universal part, and in
[Czech](../cs/overview/specific-syntax.html#ellipsis) and
[English](../en/overview/specific-syntax.html#unpronounced-material).
But there are not satisfactory solutions to all instances of ellipsis.
