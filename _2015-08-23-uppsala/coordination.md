# Uppsala Group on Coordination and Names

## Coordination

The universal guidelines specify that the first conjunct is the head in a coordinated phrase. It has been suggested that some languages show inflection patterns indicating that the last conjunct is instead the head. We considered a number of examples but concluded that they could all be analyzed as cases where the inflection applies to the entire coordinated phrase but shows up only on one of the conjuncts. Hence, we don't find any reason to change the guidelines.

### Conjunct-sensitive agreement

One type of example is conjunct-sensitive agreement, that is, where the verb of a coordinated subject agrees with only one of the conjuncts. This happens in Latin as well as in Slavic languagues. As far as we could tell, however, the crucial factor here is proximity, meaning that the verb agrees with the first conjunct if it precedes the subject but with the last conjunct if it succeeds the subject. This is illustrated by the following contrasting examples from Serbo-Croatian:

Ju…e su uništena sva sela i sve varošice
 yesterday are destroyedPL.N all villagesN and all townsF
 ‘All villages and all towns were destroyed yesterday.’
 b. Sva sela i sve varošice su uništene 
 
~~~ sdparse
Juce su uništena sva sela i sve varošice . \n yesterday are destroyed-PL.N all villages-N and all towns-F .
conj(sela, varošice)
nsubj(uništena, sela)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sva sela i sve varošice su uništene . \n all villages-N and all towns-F are destroyed-PL.F .
conj(sela, varošice)
nsubj(uništene, sela)
~~~

### Inflection

Another type of example
 

## Names

The universal guidelines specify that multiword names without regular syntactic structure should be annotated as head-initial structures with the name relation. Again it has been suggested that some languages show inflection patterns indicating that the last word is the head and again we concluded that these can be analyzed as cases where the inflection applies to the entire name but shows up only on the last element. Hence, we don't find any reason to change the guidelines here either.
