# Uppsala Group on Future of UD

Aitziber, Anders, Filip, Jan, Jenna, Tommi, Veronika, Zeljko

This group discussed possible extensions towards annotation of semantics. 

Discussion covered the following topics:

- semantic roles: which ones, extent, representation
- word senses: which "ontology", difficulties with IAA
- propbanking/valency
- conjunct propagation
- Named entities (wrt to existing annotation guidelines in UD)
- Grounding
- co-reference, information structure, discourse
- ellipsis / NULL element addition
- in view of preceding group discussions, especially MWE group, LVCs and idioms
- principles, minimal set of annotation to be called "semantic annotation"


Group-internal consensus:

- no change to current format and structure - if anything, must be "add-on" (only addition to current scheme and format)
- basis features to include in "UD Semantics 1.0":
-- exlicitly identified content words
-- graph structure over content words, with conjunct propagated ("effective heads")
-- labeled relations on every "semantic" edge
-- LVCs and idioms annotated
-- Named entities, labeled at least on "top level" hierarchy
-- NULL words: only positively defined
-- WSD with caution (maybe not in UD Semantics 1.0 - which ontology??)
-- something should be out by end of next year (process: survey of treebanks, guidelines, annotation)
