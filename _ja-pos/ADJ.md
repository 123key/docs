### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their
properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_その 車 は 赤い.&nbsp;_ “The car is red.”

The `ADJ` tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See [DET]()
for determiners and [NUM]() for cardinal numerals.

Nominal adjectives (_自由&nbsp;_ “free”) are also classified into `ADJ`,
which are a kind of noun and behave like
ordinary adjectives in being followed by an auxiliary verb (e.g. だ). 
Note that they are tagged [NOUN](), when they are used as nouns 
(e.g. _自由&nbsp;を&nbsp;手に入れる&nbsp;_ “gain freedom”).

Japanese has a small group of adnominal words that
usually precede noun phrases.
Although most of them are pronominal adjectives (e.g. _あの&nbsp;_ “that”, _どの&nbsp;_ “which”) and classified as determiner [DET](),
some words are tagged [ADJ]() (e.g. _同じ&nbsp;_ “same”, _大きな&nbsp;_ “big”).

### Examples

- _大きい&nbsp;_ “big” (形状詞-一般)

- _自由 (+だ)&nbsp;_ “free” (形状詞-一般)
- _赤い&nbsp;_ “red” (形状詞-一般)
