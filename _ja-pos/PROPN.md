### Definition

A proper noun is a noun that is the name of a specific individual, place, or object. Note that names of days of week (e.g. 月曜, 日曜) are not considered propernouns.

Multi-word named entities have internal syntactic structure, which is preserved in the annotation. The headword is usually noun or suffix and there may be other nouns involved. They will be tagged either PROPN or NOUN. For instance,
An NE _長谷寺&nbsp;_ “Hasedera temple”consists of a proper noun
_長谷&nbsp;_ “Hase”and an ordinary noun _寺&nbsp;_ “temple”.


### Examples

- _京都&nbsp;_ “Kyoto” city name(名詞-固有名詞)
- _鈴木&nbsp;_ “Suzuki” personal name(名詞-固有名詞)
