### Definition
Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The NOUN tag is intended for common nouns only. See PROPN for proper nouns and PRON for pronouns.

Stems of nominal verbs (e.g. _質問&nbsp;_ “question”) are also tagged with
`NOUN` when they are used as nouns (e.g. 質問 が ありません
“there is no question”).
Note that they are tagged `VERB', when they function as verbs in being followed by an auxiliary verb (e.g. する).

Stems of nominal verbs (e.g. 質問“question”) are tagged also classified into ADJ, which are a kind of noun and behave like ordinary adjectives in being followed by a auxiliary verb (e.g. だ). Note that they are tagged NOUN, when they are used as nouns (e.g. 自由 を 手に入れる  “gain freedom”).


Czech nouns have the lexical feature Gender. Furthermore, the nouns inflect for Number and Case.

A verbal noun can be derived productively from almost every verb (e.g. dělat  “to do” → dělání  “doing”). While in other languages a corresponding form may be called gerund and tagged VERB, in Czech it is tagged NOUN. It has always the neuter gender and the full number-case inflectional paradigm.
