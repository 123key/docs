### Definition
Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The NOUN tag is intended for common nouns only. See PROPN for proper nouns and PRON for pronouns.

Stems of nominal verbs (e.g. _質問&nbsp;_ “question”) are also tagged with
`NOUN` when they are used as nouns (e.g. 質問 が ありません
“there is no question”).
Note that they are tagged `VERB', when they function as verbs in being followed by an auxiliary verb (e.g. する).

### Examples

- _<b>木</b>&nbsp;_ “tree” (名詞)
- _<b>質問</b>&nbsp;_ “question” (名詞)
- _<b>こと</b>&nbsp;_  formal noun (名詞)
- _<b>副</b>&nbsp; 社長&nbsp;_ “<b>vice</b> president” (接頭辞)
- _5&nbsp; <b>回</b>&nbsp;_ “5 <b>times</b>” (接尾辞)
