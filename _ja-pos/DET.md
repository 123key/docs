### Definition

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc.

Japanese do not have articles, and the traditional grammar of Japanese does not
have determiners as a word class.
There is a small group of adnominal words which are tagged `adnominal` / 連体詞 (admoninal adjective), some words in the class are pronominal adjectives
 (e.g. _<b>あの</b>&nbsp;_ “that”, _<b>どの</b>&nbsp;_ “which”) and classified as determiner [DET](),
while others are tagged [ADJ]() (e.g. _同じ&nbsp;_ “same”, _大きな&nbsp;_ “big”).

### Examples

- demonstrative determiners: _<b>この</b>, <b>その</b>, <b>あの</b>, <b>どの</b>&nbsp;_ “this, that, that, which” (`adnominal` / 連体詞)
