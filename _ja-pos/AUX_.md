### Definition

The definition of Japanese `AUX` is different from that in European language focused on modal verbs.  
The `AUX` tag is used for words tagged by `auxiliary_verb` / 助動詞 in UniDic and functional verbs / adjectives.

### Examples

- _食べ<b>た</b>&nbsp;_ “eat”+PAST (`auxiliary_verb` / 助動詞) : `AUX` for past tense marker which follows a `VERB' "食べ"
- _勉強<b>する</b>&nbsp;_ “study” (`verb (bound)` / 動詞-非自立可能) : verbify a functional noun
- _食べて<b>いる</b>&nbsp;_ “be studying”(progressive) (`verb (bound)` / 動詞-非自立可能) : a functional verb for progressive aspect
- _食べ<b>ない</b>&nbsp;_ “not study”(negation) (`adjective\_i (bound)` / 形容詞-非自立可能) :  a functional adjective for negation
