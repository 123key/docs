A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to another clause. Similar to <code>case</code>, it can be a preposition, a subordinate conjunction or an adverb (also part of a multiword expression). Unlike <code>case</code> though, it introduces clauses, not complements. The <code>mark</code> element is a dependent of the subordinate clause head.
