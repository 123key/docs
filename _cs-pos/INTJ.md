### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _ano_, _jo_, _ne_, etc.
