# Introduction

The Norwegian UD treebank is based on the Bokmål section of the Norwegian
Dependency Treebank (NDT), which is a syntactic treebank of Norwegian.
NDT was developed 2011-2014 at the National Library of Norway in collaboration
with the Text Laboratory and the Department of Informatics at the
University of Oslo. NDT has been automatically converted to the UD
scheme by Lilja Øvrelid at the University of Oslo.
