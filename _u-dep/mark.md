## mark: marker

A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to
another clause. For a complement clause, this will typically be "that"
or "whether". For an adverbial clause, the marker is typically a
preposition like "while" or "although". The mark is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head.
