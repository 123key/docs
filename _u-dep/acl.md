## `{{ page.title }}`: {{ page.shortdef }}

`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a noun, in
contrast to the [advcl]() relation which is used for adverbial clauses
that modify a predicate. The head of the `acl` relation is the noun
that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that
modifies the noun.

~~~ sdparse
the issues as he sees them
acl(issues, sees)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Cette affaire Ã  suivre \n This case to follow 
acl(affaire, suivre)
~~~

This relation is also used for optional depictives.

~~~ sdparse
She entered the room sad
acl(She, sad)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He painted the model naked
acl(model, naked)
~~~

A relative clause is an instance of `acl`, characterized by finiteness and a trace of 
the modified noun in the embedded clause.

~~~ sdparse
I saw the man you love
acl(man, love)
~~~
