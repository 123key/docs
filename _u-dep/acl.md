## acl: clausal modifier of noun

*acl* stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a noun, in contrast to the *advcl* relation which is used for adverbial clauses that modify a predicate. The head of the *acl* relation is the noun that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that modifies the noun.

A relative clause is an instance of *acl*: the relation points from the noun that is modified to the head of
the relative clause, normally a verb.
