Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context.

(TODO: `DET` example)

Finnish has no true articles (see e.g. [WALS](http://wals.info/valuesets/37A-fin)) and many formalizations of Finnish morphology don't involve a determiner (or related) tag.

## Diffs

### Turku Dependency Treebank

No `DET` tag (or related) is annotated in TDT, and `DET` is
not used in the current version of the UD Finnish corpus.
