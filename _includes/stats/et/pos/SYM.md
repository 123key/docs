## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.048387 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.839644).

The 1st highest number of forms (2) was observed with the lemma “&”: <em>&, &amp;</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (2) was observed with the lemma “B”: <em>B, B-</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (2) was observed with the lemma “C5”: <em>C5, C5-ga</em>.

`SYM` occurs with 6 features: [et-feat/Abbr]() (79; 75% instances), [et-feat/Case]() (11; 10% instances), [et-feat/Number]() (11; 10% instances), [et-feat/NumForm]() (3; 3% instances), [et-feat/NumType]() (3; 3% instances), [et-feat/Hyph]() (1; 1% instances)

`SYM` occurs with 9 feature-value pairs: `Abbr=Yes`, `Case=Com`, `Case=Gen`, `Case=Nom`, `Case=Tra`, `Hyph=Yes`, `NumForm=Digit`, `NumType=Card`, `Number=Sing`

`SYM` occurs with 9 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Abbr=Yes` (74 tokens).
Examples: <em>C5, AB, sulev@ekspress.ee, D66, U, anne@ekspress.ee, x, °C, .ee, 11°</em>
