## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `X` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.041949).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “ATM+i”: <em>ATMi</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “KGB+0”: <em>KGB</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “Mr+0”: <em>Mr</em>.

`X` occurs with 3 features: [et-feat/Abbr]() (5; 63% instances), [et-feat/Case]() (1; 13% instances), [et-feat/Number]() (1; 13% instances)

`X` occurs with 3 feature-value pairs: `Abbr=Yes`, `Case=Gen`, `Number=Sing`

`X` occurs with 3 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Abbr=Yes` (4 tokens).
Examples: <em>KGB, Mr, cm, km/h, ATMi</em>


## Relations

`X` nodes are attached to their parents using 4 different relations: [et-dep/nmod]() (5; 63% instances), [et-dep/aux]() (1; 13% instances), [et-dep/conj]() (1; 13% instances), [et-dep/dep]() (1; 13% instances)

Parents of `X` nodes belong to 5 different parts of speech: [NOUN]() (2; 25% instances), [NUM]() (2; 25% instances), [VERB]() (2; 25% instances), [ADV]() (1; 13% instances), [PROPN]() (1; 13% instances)

8 (100%) `X` nodes are leaves.

The highest child degree of a `X` node is 0.
