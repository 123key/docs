The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “%”: <em>%</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “&”: <em>&</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “*”: <em>*</em>.

`SYM` does not occur with any features.


## Relations
