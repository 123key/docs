`X` nodes are attached to their parents using 5 different relations: [gl-dep/conj]() (4; 44% instances), [gl-dep/list]() (2; 22% instances), [gl-dep/appos]() (1; 11% instances), [gl-dep/nmod]() (1; 11% instances), [gl-dep/root]() (1; 11% instances)

Parents of `X` nodes belong to 3 different parts of speech: [NOUN]() (7; 78% instances), [PROPN]() (1; 11% instances), [ROOT]() (1; 11% instances)

6 (67%) `X` nodes are leaves.

2 (22%) `X` nodes have one child.

1 (11%) `X` nodes have two children.

The highest child degree of a `X` node is 2.
