## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `VERB` is 1.860311 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.173797).

The 1st highest number of forms (16) was observed with the lemma “be”: <em>'m, 're, 's, ai, am, are, be, been, being, is, m, r, re, s, was, were</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (6) was observed with the lemma “bear”: <em>bear, beared, bearing, bears, bore, born</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (6) was observed with the lemma “know”: <em>knew, know, knowing, known, knows, no</em>.

`VERB` occurs with 6 features: [en-feat/VerbForm]() (34072; 100% instances), [en-feat/Tense]() (20271; 59% instances), [en-feat/Mood]() (15990; 47% instances), [en-feat/Number]() (5697; 17% instances), [en-feat/Person]() (5680; 17% instances), [en-feat/Voice]() (1394; 4% instances)

`VERB` occurs with 13 feature-value pairs: `Mood=Imp`, `Mood=Ind`, `Number=Plur`, `Number=Sing`, `Person=1`, `Person=3`, `Tense=Past`, `Tense=Pres`, `VerbForm=Fin`, `VerbForm=Ger`, `VerbForm=Inf`, `VerbForm=Part`, `Voice=Pass`

`VERB` occurs with 15 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `VerbForm=Inf` (9474 tokens).
Examples: <em>be, have, get, know, do, go, make, take, see, like</em>
