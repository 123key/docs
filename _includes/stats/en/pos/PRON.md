The 1st highest number of forms (80) was observed with the lemma “_”: <em>'em, 's, 'ye, I, Whoever, Yer, a, all, another, any, anybody, anyone, anything, both, each, either, else, everybody, everyone, everything, half, he, her, hers, herself, him, himself, his, it, its, itself, me, mine, my, myself, neither, no, nobody, none, noone, nothing, one, ones, oneself, other, others, our, ours, ourselves, own, she, some, somebody, someone, something, such, that, their, theirs, them, themselves, there, these, they, this, those, us, we, wha', what, whatever, whatnot, which, who, whom, whose, you, your, yours, yourself</em>.

`PRON` does not occur with any features.
