### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the VERB tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_ and _copulas_ but it does not cover _auxiliary_ and _modal verbs._ For these see the <a href="AUX.html">AUX</a> tag.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either {{ page.title }} or <a href="ADJ.html">ADJ</a>.

Note that some verb forms such as _gerunds_ and _infinitives_ may share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either {{ page.title }} or <a href="NOUN.html">NOUN</a>.

Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either {{ page.title }} or <a href="ADV.html">ADV</a>.
