### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either {{ page.title }} or <a href="ADJ.html">ADJ</a>.

### Examples
