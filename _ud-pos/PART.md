### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that encodes grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense, or case. Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur. 

Note that the {{ page.title }} tag does not cover so-called _verbal particles_ in Germanic languages, as in _give <span style='color:red'>in</span>_ or _end <span style='color:red'>up</span>_. These are adpositions or adverbs by origin and are tagged accordingly <a href="ADP.html">ADP</a> or <a href="ADV.html">ADV</a>. Separable verb prefixes in German are treated analogically.

### Examples

 - Negation [en]: _not_
 - Possessive marker [en]: _'s_
 - Topic/case marker [ja]: _ga, wa_
 - Sentence modality [cs]: _ať, kéž, nechť_ (_Let's_ do it! _If only_ I could do it over. _May you_ have an enjoyable stay!)
