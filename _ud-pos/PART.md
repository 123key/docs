### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning
and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech
(e.g. <a href="ADP.html">adpositions</a>,
<a href="CONJ.html">coordinating conjunctions</a>,
<a href="SCONJ.html">subordinating conjunctions</a> or
<a href="AUX.html">auxiliary verbs</a>).
Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc.
Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur. 

Note that the {{ page.title }} tag does not cover so-called _verbal particles_ in Germanic languages, as in _give <span style='color:red'>in</span>_ or _end <span style='color:red'>up</span>_. These are adpositions or adverbs by origin and are tagged accordingly <a href="ADP.html">ADP</a> or <a href="ADV.html">ADV</a>. Separable verb prefixes in German are treated analogically.

Note that not all function words that are traditionally called particles in Japanese automatically qualify for the {{ page.title }} tag.
Some of them do, e.g. the question particle か _ka._
Others (e.g. に _ni,_ の _no_) are parallel to adpositions in other languages and should thus be tagged
<a href="ADP.html">ADP</a>.

### Examples

 - Possessive marker: [en] _'s_
 - Negation particle: [en] _not;_ [de] _nicht;_ [tr] _mu_
 - Question particle: [ja] か _ka_ (adding this particle to the end of a clause turns the clause into a question)
 - Sentence modality: [cs] _ať, kéž, nechť_ (_Let's_ do it! _If only_ I could do it over. _May you_ have an enjoyable stay!)
