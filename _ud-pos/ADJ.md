## {{ page.title }}: {{ page.shortdef }}

### Definition

**Adjectives** are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_The car is green._

The {{ page.title }} tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See <a href="DET.html">DET</a> for determiners and <a href="NUM.html">NUM</a> for quantifiers and cardinal numerals.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adjectives in our universal tagging scheme. In particular, _ordinal numerals_ (more precisely _adjectival_ ordinal numerals, because Czech has also adverbial ones) behave both morphologically and syntactically as adjectives and are tagged {{ page.title }}.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either <a href="VERB.html">VERB</a> or {{ page.title }}.
