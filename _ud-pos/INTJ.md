### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.

Not that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains their original category when used in exclamations. For example, _God_ is a NOUN even in exclamatory uses.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles such as _yes_, _no_, _uhuh_, etc.

### Examples

 - psst
 - ouch
