### Definition

A proper noun is a noun that is the name of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that PNOUN is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties (such as occurring without an article in the singular in English). When other phrases or sentences are used as names, the component words retain their original tags. For example, in _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_, _Cat_ is NOUN, _on_ is ADP, _a_ is DET, etc.

### Examples

 - _Mary, John_
 - _London_
