# Universal Dependencies: Features of Tokens<br />Part 2: Inflectional Features

## Definiteness

Definiteness is
typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and articles. Its value
distinguishes whether we are talking about something known and
concrete, or something general or unknown. It can be marked on
definite and indefinite articles, or directly on nouns, adjectives
etc. In Arabic, definiteness is also called
the &ldquo;state&rdquo;.

### Ind: indefinite

Examples: [en]
<span style='color: red'><I>a</I></span><I>
dog</I>

### Def: definite

Examples: [en]
<span style='color: red'><I>the</I></span><I>
dog</I>

### Red: reduced

Used
in <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus">construct
state</A> in
Arabic. If two nouns are in genitive relation, the first one (the
&ldquo;nomen regens&rdquo;) has &ldquo;reduced definiteness,&rdquo;
the second is the genitive and can be either definite or indefinite.
Reduced form has neither the definite morpheme (article), nor the
indefinite morpheme (nunation).

Examples:
[ar]
indefinite state: حلوَةٌ
<EM>ḥulwatun</EM>
&ldquo;a sweet&rdquo;; definite state: الحلوَةُ
<EM>al-ḥulwatu</EM>
&ldquo;the sweet&rdquo;; <span style='color: red'>حلوَةُ
</span><EM><span style='color: red'>ḥulwatu</span></EM>
&ldquo;sweet of&rdquo;.

### Com: complex

Used in
<A HREF="http://books.google.cz/books?id=rs3hzfgj3hoC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=arabic+improper+annexation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d6gGCpprOX&amp;sig=3G6YkRZsIy_EL0OCEh7_V7qqnlE&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=ZasDTuLhGc_vsgaLlcyeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arabic%20improper%20annexation&amp;f=false">improper
annexation</A> in
Arabic. The genitive construction described above normally consists
of two nouns (first reduced, second genitive). That is called proper
annexation or iḍāfa. If the first member is an adjective
or adjectivally used participle and the second member is a definite
noun, the construction is called improper annexation or false iḍāfa.
The result is a compound adjective that is usually used as an
attributive adjunct and thus must agree in definiteness with the noun
it modifies. Its first part (the adjective or participle) may get
again the definite article. Although it may look the same as the form
for the definite state, it is assigned a special value of <EM>complex</EM>
state to reflect the different origin. See also <A HREF="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/padt/PADT_1.0/docs/papers/2004-nemlar-padt.pdf">Hajič
et al.</A> page
3.

Examples:
[ar] مُخْتَلِفٌ
<EM>muxtalifun</EM>
&ldquo;different/various&rdquo; (active participle, Form VIII);
نَوْعٌ
ج أنْوَاعٌ
<EM>nawˀun
ja anwāˀun</EM>
&ldquo;kind&rdquo;; مُخْتَلِفُ
الأنْوَاعِ
<EM>muxtalifu
al-anwāˀi</EM>
&ldquo;of various kinds&rdquo; (false iḍāfa); مَشَاكِلُ
مُخْتَلِفَةُ
الأنْوَاعِ
<EM>mašākilu
muxtalifatu al-anwāˀi</EM>
&ldquo;problems of various kinds&rdquo;; اَلْمَشَاكِلُ
<span style='color: red'>الْمُخْتَلِفَةُ</span>
الأنْوَاعِ
<EM>al-mašākilu
</EM><EM><span style='color: red'>al-muxtalifatu</span></EM><EM>
al-anwāˀi</EM>
&ldquo;the problems of various kinds&rdquo;.

## Negativeness

Negativeness is
typically a feature of verbs, adjectives, sometimes also adverbs and
nouns in languages that negate using bound morphemes. For instance,
all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated using the prefix <I>ne-</I>.
In
English, verbs are negated using the particle (adverb?) <I>not</I>
and adjectives are also negated using prefixes, although the process
is less productive than in Czech <I>(wise
&ndash; unwise, probable &ndash; improbable)</I>.

Note that Negativeness=Neg is not the
same thing as PronType=Neg. For pronouns and other pronominal parts
of speech there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and
adjectives. (There is no such thing as &ldquo;affirmative pronoun&rdquo;.)

The
negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
particles <I>yes</I>
and <I>no</I>.

### Pos: positive, affirmative

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>přišel</I></span>
(he
came)

### Neg: negative

Examples: [cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>nepřišel</I></span>
(he
did
not come)

## Degree

Degree
of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some adjectives
and adverbs.

### Pos: positive, first degree

This
is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without
comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this degree
is traditionally called &ldquo;positive&rdquo;, negative properties
can be compared, too.

Examples:
[en] <span style='color: red'><I>young</I></span><I>
man</I>,
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>mladý</I></span><I>
muž</I>

### Cmp: comparative, second degree

The
quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

Examples:
[en] <I>the
man is </I><span style='color: red'><I>younger</I></span><I>
than me</I>,
[cs]
<I>ten
muž je </I><span style='color: red'><I>mladší</I></span><I>
než já</I>

### Sup: superlative, third degree

The
quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

Examples:
[en] <I>this
is the </I><span style='color: red'><I>youngest</I></span><I>
man in our team</I>,
[cs]
<I>toto
je </I><span style='color: red'><I>nejmladší</I></span><I>
muž v našem týmu</I>

### Abs: absolute superlative

Some
languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of the
given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

Examples:
[es]
<I>guapo</I>
= handsome,
<span style='color: red'><I>guapísimo</I></span>
=
indescribably handsome

## Person

Person
is typically feature of personal and possessive pronouns, and of
verbs. On verbs it is in fact an agreement feature that marks the
person of the verb's subject (some languages, e.g. Basque, can also
mark person of objects). Person marked on verbs makes it unnecessary
to always add a personal pronoun as subject and thus subjects are
sometimes dropped (pro-drop languages).

The
&ldquo;Person&rdquo; feature may interact with the feature of
politeness, see there.

### 1: first person

In
singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. Some languages (e.g. Taiwanese) distinguish inclusive and
exclusive 1<SUP>st</SUP> person plural pronouns: the former include
the addressee of the utterance (i.e. <I>I + you</I>), the latter
exclude them (i.e. <I>I + they</I>).

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>I</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>we</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělám</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>I</span>
do)

### 2: second person

In
singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the utterance
/ text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and optionally some
third persons too.

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>you</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>š</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>you</span>
do)

### 3: third person

The
third person refers to one or more persons that are neither speakers
nor addressees.

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>he</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>she</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>it</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>they</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělá</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>he/she/it</span><span style='color: red'>
do</span><span style='color: red'>es</span>)

## Politeness

Various
languages have various means to express politeness or respect; some
of the means are morphological.

In
quite a few languages the polite mode involves changing pronoun,
person or number when addressing or talking about a respectable
person. In Czech, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> person plural is used instead of
singular; this involves both the pronoun and the finite verb but not
a participle, which remains in singular. In this case, different
words are selected but all of them also exist in the informal mode.
The change is that morphological plural may now be either semantic
singular or plural.

In
German, Spanish or Hindi, both number and person are changed
(morphological 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
person is used as semantic 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
person) and in addition, special pronouns are used that do not appear
in the informal register ([de] <I>Sie</I>;
[es] <I>usted,
ustedes</I>;
[hi] आप
<I>āpa</I>).

In
Japanese, verbs
and other words have polite and informal forms but
the polite register is not restricted to addressing people.

### Inf: informal register

Usage
varies but if the language distinguishes levels of politeness, then
the informal register is usually meant for communication with family
members and close friends.

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>ty
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>jdeš
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>/
vy </I></span><span style='color: red'><I>jdete</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur);
[de]
<span style='color: red'><I>du
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>gehst
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>/
ihr </I></span><span style='color: red'><I>geht</I></span>
(you go.Sing/Plur); [es] <span style='color: red'><I>tú
vas / vosotros vais</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur); [ja]
<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><span style='color: red'>行かない
</span></FONT><span style='color: red'><I>ikanai</I></span>
(will
not go)<I>.</I>

### Pol: polite register

Usage
varies but if the language distinguishes levels of politeness, then
the polite register is usually meant for communication with strangers
and people of higher social status than the one of the speaker.

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>vy
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>jdete</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur);
[de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Sie
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>gehen</I></span>
(you go.Sing/Plur); [es] <span style='color: red'><I>usted
</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>va
/ ustedes van</I></span>
(you
go.Sing/Plur); [ja]
<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><span style='color: red'>行きません
</span></FONT><span style='color: red'><I>ikimasen</I></span>
(will
not go).

## PossGender

Possessive
adjectives and pronouns may have two different genders: that of the
possessed object (gender agreement with modified noun) and that of
the possessor (lexical feature, inherent gender). The PossGender
feature captures the possessor's gender. For simplicity, the set of
possible values is identical to Gender, although only a subset has
been observed in corpora so far.

In
the Czech examples below, the masculine PossGender implies using one
of the suffixes <I>-</I><I>ův, -ova, -ovo,</I>
and the feminine PossGender implies using one of <I>-</I><I>in,
-ina, -ino</I>.

### Masc: masculine possessor

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>otcův
syn</I></span>
(father's
son; PossGender=Masc|Gender=Masc);
<span style='color: red'><I>otcova
dcera</I></span>
(father's
daughter; PossGender=Masc|Gender=Fem);
<span style='color: red'><I>otcovo
dítě</I></span>
(father's
child; PossGender=Masc|Gender=Neut).

### Fem: feminine possessor

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>m</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>atčin
syn</I></span>
(mother's
son; PossGender=Fem|Gender=Masc);
<span style='color: red'><I>matčina
dcera</I></span>
(mother's
daughter; PossGender=Fem|Gender=Fem);
<span style='color: red'><I>matčino
dítě</I></span>
(mother's
child; PossGender=Fem|Gender=Neut).

## PossNumber

Possessives
may have two different numbers: that of the possessed object (number
agreement with modified noun) and that of the possessor. The
PossNumber feature captures the possessor's number. For simplicity,
the set of possible values is identical to Number, although only a
subset has been observed in corpora so far.

### Sing: singular possessor

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>my,
his</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>,
her, its</I></span>;
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>můj</I></span><I>
pes</I>
(my
dog; PossNumber=Sing|Number=Sing); <span style='color: red'><I>mí</I></span><I>
psi</I>
(my
dogs; PossNumber=Sing|Number=Plur).

### Plur: plural possessor

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>our,
t</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>heir</I></span>;
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>náš</I></span><I>
pes</I>
(our
dog; PossNumber=Plur|Number=Sing); <span style='color: red'><I>naši</I></span><I>
psi</I>
(our
dogs; PossNumber=Plur|Number=Plur).

## PossedNumber

PossedNumber
is the possessee's (possessed, owned noun phrase's) number. In
Hungarian, possession can be marked on the possessor or on the
possessed. It is possible, though rare, that a noun has three
distinct number features: its own grammatical number, number of its
possessor and number of its possession. Examples from the
Multext-East Hungarian lexicon:

<UL>
	<LI><I>könnyedén</I> (SSS)

	<UL>
		<LI><I>könny</I> = a tear (singular)

		<LI><I>könnyed</I> = your tear
		(singular owner)

		<LI><I>könnyedé</I> = (possession) of
		your tear (singular possession)

		<LI><I>könnyedén</I> = (on the
		possession) of your tear (superessive case)

	</UL>
	<LI><I>ellenfeleié</I> (PSS)

	<UL>
		<LI><I>ellenfél</I> = an opponent
		(singular)

		<LI><I>ellenfele</I> = his/her/its
		opponent (singular owner)

		<LI><I>ellenfelei</I> = his/her/its
		opponents (core plural, singular owner)

		<LI><I>ellenfeleié</I> = (possession)
		of his/her/its opponents (singular possession)

	</UL>
	<LI><I>életeké</I> (SPS)

	<UL>
		<LI><I>él</I> = point (singular)

		<LI><I>élek</I> = points (plural)

		<LI><I>élén</I> = his/her/its point
		(singular owner)

		<LI><I>élünk</I> = our point (plural
		owner)

		<LI><I>életeké</I> = (possession) of
		our point (singular possession)

	</UL>
	<LI><I>tárgyalópartnereinkét</I> (PPS)

	<UL>
		<LI><I>tárgyalópartner</I> =
		negotiator (singular)

		<LI><I>tárgyalópartnerei</I> =
		his/her/its negotiators (plural, singular owner)

		<LI><I>tárgyalópartnereinkét</I> = (possession) of our
		negotiators (plural, plural owner, singular possession, accusative
		case)

	</UL>
</UL>
Words marked for plural possessions are very rare, though. Note
that in the following example from Multext-East, Columbus is marked
for plural possession, but not for his own owner. 


<UL>
	<LI><I>Kolumbuszéinál</I>

	<UL>
		<LI><I>Kolumbusz</I> = Columbus
		(singular)

		<LI><I>Kolumbuszéi</I> =
		(possessions) of Columbus (plural possession)

		<LI><I>Kolumbuszéinál</I> = (at the possessions) of Columbus
		(adessive case)

	</UL>
</UL>
### Sing: singular possession

### Plur: plural possession

## PossPerson

PossPerson
is possessor's person, marked e.g. on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

Note
that there is currently a sort of inconsitency in Interset: since
this feature was introduced, it would be logical to use it also for
possessive pronouns in other languages. Yet the possessor's person of
these pronouns is traditionally captured in the &ldquo;Person&rdquo;
feature. Also note that using PossPerson for possessive pronouns
might introduce inconsistency at the other end because in some
languages, possessive pronouns are actually identical to personal
pronouns in the genitive case.

### 1: first person possessor

Examples:
[hu]
<I>kutya</I>
= dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyám</I></span>
=
my dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>nk</I></span>
=
our dog.

### 2: second person possessor

Examples:
[hu]
<I>kutya</I>
= dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>d</I></span>
=
your.Sing dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>tok</I></span>
=
your.Plur dog.

### 3: third person possessor

Examples:
[hu]
<I>kutya</I>
= dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>ja</I></span>
=
his/her/its dog;
<span style='color: red'><I>kutyá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>juk</I></span>
=
their dog.

## VerbForm

Even
though the name of the feature seems to suggest that it is used
exclusively with verbs, it is not the case. Some verb forms in some
languages actually form a gray zone between verbs and other parts of
speech (nouns, adjectives and adverbs). For instance, participles may
be either classified as verbs or as adjectives, depending on language
and context. In both cases VerbForm=Part may be used to separate them
from other verb forms or other types of adjectives.

### Fin: finite verb

Rule
of thumb: if it has non-empty Mood, it is finite. But beware that
some tagsets conflate verb forms and moods into one feature.

Examples:
[en]
<I>I
</I><span style='color: red'><I>do</I></span><I>,
he </I><span style='color: red'><I>does</I></span>.

### Inf: infinitive

Infinitive is
the citation form of verbs in many languages. Unlike in English, it
often has morphological form that is distinct from the finite forms.
Infinitives may be used together with auxiliaries to form
periphrastic tenses (e.g. future tense [cs] <I>budu
</I><span style='color: red'><I>sedět</I></span><I>
v letadle</I>
(I
will sit in a plane)), they appear as arguments of modal verbs etc.
In some languages they behave similarly to nouns and are used as such
(similar to the gerund in English).

Examples:
[de]
<I>ich
muss </I><span style='color: red'><I>gehen</I></span>
(I must go).

### Sup: supine

Supine is a rare verb form. It
survives in some Slavic languages (Slovenian) and is used instead of
infinitive as the argument of motion verbs <I>(I must go)</I>.

A form called &ldquo;supine&rdquo; also
exists in Swedish but I think that the usage is different there
(Joakim?)

### Part: participle

Participle
is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and
adjectives. Its usage varies across languages. It may be used to form
various periphrastic verb forms such as complex tenses and passives;
it may be also used purely adjectively.

Other
features may help to distinguish past/present participles (English),
active/passive participles (Czech), imperfect/perfect participles
(Hindi) etc.

Examples:
[en]
<I>he
could have </I><span style='color: red'><I>been
prepared</I></span><I>
if he had </I><span style='color: red'><I>forseen</I></span><I>
it</I>;
<I>I
will be </I><span style='color: red'><I>driving</I></span><I>
home</I>.

### Trans: transgressive

The
transgressive, also called adverbial participle, is a non-finite verb
form that shares properties of verbs and adverbs. It appears e.g. in
Slavic and Indo-Aryan languages.

Examples:
[cs] <I>zírali na
mne, pevně </I><span style='color: red'><I>svírajíce</I></span><I>
své zbraně</I>
(they stared at me <span style='color: red'>while
gripping</span> their guns firmly); <span style='color: red'><I>udělavši</I></span><I>
večeři, zavolala rodinu ke stolu</I>
(<span style='color: red'>having
prepared</span> the dinner, she called her
family to the table).

### Ger: gerund

Gerund
is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and nouns.
In English it shares the morphological
form with present participle, which may mean that the tagset will not
distinguish it from the participle.

Examples:
[en] <I>I look forward to </I><span style='color: red'><I>seeing</I></span><I>
you</I>; <I>he
turns a blind eye to my </I><span style='color: red'><I>being</I></span><I>
late</I>.

## Mood

Mood
is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb
forms.

### Ind: indicative

The
indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative
merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen,
without adding any attitude of the speaker.

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Studuješ</I></span><I>
na univerzitě.</I> [de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Du studierst</I></span><I>
an der Universität.</I>
(<span style='color: red'>You
study</span> at the university.)

### Imp: imperative

The
speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Studuj</I></span><I>
na univerzitě!</I> [de]
<span style='color: red'><I>Studiere</I></span><I>
an der Universität!</I>
(<span style='color: red'>S</span><span style='color: red'>tudy</span>
at the university!)

### Cnd: conditional

The
conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).

Examples:
[cs] <I>Kdy</I><span style='color: red'><I>bych</I></span><I>
byl chytrý, studoval </I><span style='color: red'><I>bych</I></span><I>
na univerzitě.</I>
(If
I were smart I <span style='color: red'>would</span>
study at the university;
note that only the auxiliary <I>bych</I>
is specific to conditional; the active participle <I>byl</I>
is also needed to analytically form the conditional mood, however, it
will only be tagged as participle because it can also be used to form
past tense indicative.)

### Pot: potential

The
action of the verb is likely but not certain. Used e.g. in Finnish.

### Sub: subjunctive / conjunctive

The
subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in subordinate
clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or otherwise
uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the conditional
meaning.

Examples:
[fr] <I>Je veux que tu le </I><span style='color: red'><I>fasses</I></span><I>.</I>
(I want you to do it; lit. I want that you it
do.Sub.)

### Jus: jussive

The
jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens. Used e.g.
in Arabic.

### Qot: quotative

The
quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.

### Opt: optative

Used
e.g. in Turkish in exclamations like &ldquo;May you have a long
life!&rdquo; or &ldquo;If only I were rich!&rdquo;

### Des: desiderative

The
desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb &ldquo;want to&rdquo;:
&ldquo;He <span style='color: red'>wants to come</span>.&rdquo;
Used e.g. in Turkish.

### Nec: necessitative

The
necessitative
mood corresponds to the modal verbs
&ldquo;must, should, have to&rdquo;:
&ldquo;He <span style='color: red'>must</span><span style='color: red'>
come</span>.&rdquo; Used e.g. in Turkish.

## Tense

Tense
is a feature that specifies the time when the action took / takes /
will take place, in relation to the current moment or to another
action in the utterance. In some languages (e.g. English), some
tenses are actually combinations of tense and aspect. In other
languages (e.g. Czech), aspect and tense are separate, although not
completely independent of each other.

Note
that we are defining features that apply to a single word. If a tense
is constructed periphrastically (two or more words, e.g. auxiliary
verb indicative + participle of the main verb) and none of the
participating words are specific to this tense, then the features
will probably not directly reveal the tense. For instance, [en] <I>&ldquo;I
</I><span style='color: red'><I>had been</I></span><I> there&rdquo;</I>
is past perfect (pluperfect) tense, formed periphrastically by the
simple past tense of the auxiliary <I>to have</I> and the past
participle of the main verb <I>to be</I>. The auxiliary will be
tagged VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Past
and the participle will have VerbForm=Part|Tense=Past;
none of the two will have Tense=Pqp.
On the other hand, Portuguese can form the pluperfect morphologically
as just one word, which will thus be tagged
VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Pqp.

### Past: past tense

The
past tense denotes actions that happened before the current moment.
In English, this is the simple past
form. In German, this is the Präteritum.
In Turkish, this is the non-narrative past. In Bulgarian, there are
two synthetic past tenses, called aorist and imperfect; thus one of
these two values is used and past is not used. (<SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Note
DZ: perhaps we should merge aorist with past and leave the imperfect
as the specific case.</SPAN>)

Examples:
[en] <I>he </I><span style='color: red'><I>went</I></span><I>
home</I>

### Pres: present tense

The
present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that
usually happen.

Examples:
[en] <I>he </I><span style='color: red'><I>goes</I></span><I>
home</I>

### Fut: future tense

The
future
tense denotes actions that will happen
after the current moment.

Examples:
[es] <span style='color: red'><I>irá</I></span><I>
</I><I>a la casa</I>
(he/she/it
will go home)

### Aor: aorist

Aorist
is a special case of the past tense. In Bulgarian, this is the
aspect-neutral past tense that can be used freely with both
imperfective and perfective verbs (see also imperfect).
(<SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Note
DZ: perhaps we should merge aorist with past and leave the imperfect
as the specific case.</SPAN>)

### Imp: imperfect

Used
in e.g. Bulgarian and Croatian, imperfect is a special case of the
past tense.
Note that,
unfortunately, imperfect tense is not always the same as past tense +
imperfective aspect. For instance, in Bulgarian, there is lexical
aspect, inherent in verb meaning, and grammatical aspect, which does
not necessarily always match the lexical one. In main clauses,
imperfective verbs can have imperfect tense and perfective verbs have
perfect tense. However, both rules can be violated in embedded
clauses.

### Nar: narrative

Special case of
the past tense, this is the Turkish <EM>miş</EM>-past.
The difference is whether the speaker personally witnessed the action
he is describing, or not.

### Pqp: pluperfect

The pluperfect
denotes action that happened before another action in past. This
value does not apply to English where the pluperfect (past perfect)
is constructed analytically. It applies e.g. to Portuguese.

## Aspect

Aspect is a feature
that specifies duration of the action in time, whether the action has
been completed etc. In some languages (e.g. English), some tenses are
actually combinations of tense and aspect. In other languages (e.g.
Czech), aspect and tense are separate, although not completely
independent of each other.

In
Czech and other Slavic languages, aspect is a lexical feature. Pairs
of imperfective and perfective verbs exist and are often
morphologically related but the space is highly irregular and the
verbs are considered to belong to separate lemmas.

Interset
currently covers only a few aspect values that occurred as feature in
the corpora we have studied. See Wikipedia
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect</A>)
for a long list of other possible aspects.

### Imp: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some
time span and there is no information whether and when it was / will
be completed.

Examples: [cs]<I>
</I><I>péci</I>
=
to bake (Imp); <span style='color: red'><I>pekl</I></span><I>
chleba</I>
(he
baked / was baking a bread)

### Perf: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been
completed. Since there is emphasis on one point on the time scale
(the point of completion), this aspect does not work well with the
present tense. For example, Czech morphology can create present forms
of perfective verbs but these actually have a future meaning.

Examples: [cs]<I>
</I><I>up</I><I>éci</I>
=
to bake (Perf); <span style='color: red'><I>upekl</I></span><I>
chleba</I>
(he
baked / has baked a bread)

### Pro: prospective aspect

Used in Basque. A combination
of tense and aspect that indicates the action is in preparation to
take place.

### Prog: progressive aspect

English
progressive tenses <I>(I am eating, I
have been doing &hellip;)</I> have this
aspect. They are constructed analytically (auxiliary + present
participle) but the <I>-ing</I>
participle is so bound to progressive meaning that it seems a good
idea to annotate it with this feature (we have to distinguish it from
the past participle somehow; we may use both the &ldquo;Tense&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Aspect&rdquo; features).

In
languages other than English, the progressive meaning may be
expressed by morphemes bound to the main verb, which makes this value
even more justified. Example is Turkish.

## Voice

For
Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

### Act: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the
action (agent), the object is affected by the action (pacient).

Examples: [cs] <span style='color: red'><I>Napadli</I></span><I>
jsme nepřítele.</I>
(We
<span style='color: red'>attacked</span>
the enemy; the active participle <I>napadli</I>
can
be used to form either past tense or conditional mood; here it forms
the past tense.)

### Pass: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the
action (pacient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or it
appears as an object of the verb.

Examples: [cs] <I>J</I><I>sme
</I><span style='color: red'><I>napadeni</I></span><I>
nepřítelem.</I>
(We
are <span style='color: red'>attacked</span>
by the enemy; the passive participle <I>napadeni</I>
is
used to form passive in all tenses; here it forms the present
passive.)

### Rcp: reciprocal voice

Examples: [tr]
<span style='color: red'><I>karıştı</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>tutuştular</I></span>

### Cau: causative voice

<A HREF="https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf">Documentation</A>
of the METU Sabanci treebank classifies causative as voice (page 26).
Note that this is a feature of verbs. There are languages that have
also the causative case of nouns.

Examples: [tr]
<span style='color: red'><I>karıştırıyor</I></span>
(is
confusing)

## Style

This
may be a lexical feature (some words-lemmas are archaic, some are
colloquial) or a morphological feature (inflectional patterns may
systematically change between dialects or styles). It could be used
in many languages but only a few choose to actually annotate it. Seen
in Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Finnish and Hungarian.

### Arch: archaic, obsolete

### Rare: rare

### Form: formal, literary

### Poet: poetic

### Norm: normal, neutral

### Coll: colloquial

### Vrnc: vernacular

### Slng: slang

### Expr: expressive, emotional

### Derg: derogative

### Vulg: vulgar
