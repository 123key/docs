Degree
of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some <a href="../ud-pos/ADJ.html">adjectives</a>
and <a href="../ud-pos/ADV.html">adverbs</a>.

### Pos: positive, first degree

This
is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without
comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this degree
is traditionally called &ldquo;positive&rdquo;, negative properties
can be compared, too.

Examples:
[en] <span style='color: red'><I>young</I></span><I>
man</I>,
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>mladý</I></span><I>
muž</I>

### Cmp: comparative, second degree

The
quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

Examples:
[en] <I>the
man is </I><span style='color: red'><I>younger</I></span><I>
than me</I>,
[cs]
<I>ten
muž je </I><span style='color: red'><I>mladší</I></span><I>
než já</I>

### Sup: superlative, third degree

The
quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

Examples:
[en] <I>this
is the </I><span style='color: red'><I>youngest</I></span><I>
man in our team</I>,
[cs]
<I>toto
je </I><span style='color: red'><I>nejmladší</I></span><I>
muž v našem týmu</I>

### Abs: absolute superlative

Some
languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of the
given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

Examples:
[es]
<I>guapo</I>
= handsome,
<span style='color: red'><I>guapísimo</I></span>
=
indescribably handsome
