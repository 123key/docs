Person
is typically feature of personal and possessive pronouns, and of
verbs. On verbs it is in fact an agreement feature that marks the
person of the verb's subject (some languages, e.g. Basque, can also
mark person of objects). Person marked on verbs makes it unnecessary
to always add a personal pronoun as subject and thus subjects are
sometimes dropped (pro-drop languages).

The
&ldquo;Person&rdquo; feature may interact with the feature of
politeness, see there.

### 1: first person

In
singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. Some languages (e.g. Taiwanese) distinguish inclusive and
exclusive 1<SUP>st</SUP> person plural pronouns: the former include
the addressee of the utterance (i.e. <I>I + you</I>), the latter
exclude them (i.e. <I>I + they</I>).

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>I</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>we</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělám</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>I</span>
do)

### 2: second person

In
singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the utterance
/ text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and optionally some
third persons too.

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>you</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělá</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>š</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>you</span>
do)

### 3: third person

The
third person refers to one or more persons that are neither speakers
nor addressees.

Examples:
[en]
<span style='color: red'><I>he</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>she</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>it</I></span><I>,
</I><span style='color: red'><I>they</I></span>;
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>dělá</I></span>
(<span style='color: red'>he/she/it</span><span style='color: red'>
do</span><span style='color: red'>es</span>)
