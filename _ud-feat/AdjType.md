## {{ page.title }}: {{ page.shortdef }}

I am inclined to merge this feature with prontype, since it only deals
with pronoun-like things. Also, in Interset it distinguishes
determiners from normal adjectives while here we have this distinction
at the POS level.

### Pdt: predeterminer (as in Penn Treebank: all the students, both the brothers)

### Art: article

### Det: determiner (except numbers and other than article)
