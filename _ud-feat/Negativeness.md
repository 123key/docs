## Negativeness

Negativeness is
typically a feature of verbs, adjectives, sometimes also adverbs and
nouns in languages that negate using bound morphemes. For instance,
all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated using the prefix <I>ne-</I>.
In
English, verbs are negated using the particle (adverb?) <I>not</I>
and adjectives are also negated using prefixes, although the process
is less productive than in Czech <I>(wise
&ndash; unwise, probable &ndash; improbable)</I>.

Note that Negativeness=Neg is not the
same thing as PronType=Neg. For pronouns and other pronominal parts
of speech there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and
adjectives. (There is no such thing as &ldquo;affirmative pronoun&rdquo;.)

The
negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
particles <I>yes</I>
and <I>no</I>.

### Pos: positive, affirmative

Examples:
[cs] <span style='color: red'><I>přišel</I></span>
(he
came)

### Neg: negative

Examples: [cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>nepřišel</I></span>
(he
did
not come)
