## ccomp: clausal complement

A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause with an
internal subject (perhaps implicit) which functions like an object of the verb,
or adjective.

<!--Clausal complements for nouns are limited to complement
clauses with a subset of nouns like "fact" or "report".  We analyze
them the same (parallel to the analysis of this class as "content
clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Such clausal complements are
usually finite (though there are occasional remnant English
subjunctives).-->

Note that in the following parse the clausal complement has a subject *nosotros*
which is only implicit.

<div class="sd-parse">
Ambos sabemos bastante bien c√≥mo nos expresamos.
ccomp(sabemos, expresamos)
</div>
