## cc: coordination

A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and the
coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct. (Note: different
dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination. We take
one conjunct of a conjunction as the head of the conjunction.) A
conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also
called a `cc`, and it depends on the root predicate of the sentence.

<div class="sd-parse">
padrinos o testigos
cc(padrinos, o)
conj(padrinos, testigos)
</div>

<div class="sd-parse">
Y entonces salimos
cc(salimos, Y)
</div>
