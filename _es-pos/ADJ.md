### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. In Spanish, adjectives normally follow the noun, as in

_La casa <b>amarilla</b> está a la derecha._ "The yellow house is on the right side."

Although sometimes they may also precede the noun, as in

_La <b>blanca</b> nieve._ "The white snow."

Adjectives in Spanish agree in number and gender with the noun they modify, e.g. _la casa amarilla_ (femenine singular), _las casas amarillas_ (femenine plural).

The class of adjectives in Spanish UD also includes ordinal numbers and participial adjectives, both behaving as adjectives morphologically and syntactically.

To conform to the UD guidelines, possessive adjectives are handled as determiners [DET]().
