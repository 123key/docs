Degree of comparison is inflectional feature of some [adjectives](uk-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](uk-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>молода</b> людина&nbsp;_ “<b>young</b> person”

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _Цей чоловік <b>молодший</b> ніж тамтой.&nbsp;_ “This man is <b>younger</b> than that one.”

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _Це <b>наймолодша</b> людина в нашій команді.&nbsp;_ “This is the <b>youngest</b> person in our team”
