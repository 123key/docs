# English grammatical relations

On this page we list all relations with a few examples per relation. Some relations
may have a link to a page with further dedicated discussion.

## acomp: adjectival complement

An adjectival complement of a verb is an adjectival phrase which
functions as the complement (like an object of the verb).

<div id="simple-example" class="sd-parse">
She looks very beautiful
acomp(looks, beautiful)
</div>

## cop: copula

A copula is the relation between the complement of a copular verb and the copular verb. (We
normally take a copula as a dependent of its complement; see the [discussion](en-cop.html))

<div id="simple-example" class="sd-parse">
Bill is big
cop(big, is)
nsubj(big, Bill)
</div>

<div id="simple-example" class="sd-parse">
Bill is an honest man
cop(man, is)
nsubj(man, Bill)
</div>
