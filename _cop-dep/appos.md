Marks appositions in all free apposition constructions, as well as the special construction with ⲛϭⲓ ‘namely’. Appositions are preferred to be marked from left to right, including in sentences with nominal subject after the verb (apposition from pronoun to noun). In cases where both a nominal and pronominal realization are given to the same argument with the same function, the tightly bound argument of the verb takes precedence in receiving subject or object marking, with subsequent realizations connected as appositions. Typical cases include normal apposition (two consecutive nominal expressions with same reference and grammatical function) and the ⲛϭⲓ construction.
