### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context. Like [adjectives](ADJ),
Swedish determiners are typically inflected depending on the noun they modify,
e.g. _vår kost_ "our diet", _vårt samhälle_ "our society", _våra åsikter_ "our opinions". 

### Examples

- articles: _en_ "a/an", _ett_ "a/an", _den_ "the", _det_ "the", _de_ "the"  
- possessive determiners: _min_ "my" as in _min bil_ "my car", _deras_ "their" as in _deras attityder_ "their attitudes", _ditt jobb_ "your job"
- demonstrative determiners: _detta_ "this/that" as in _hela detta nätverk_ "this whole network" 
- interrogative determiners: _vilket_ "which/what" as in _vilket samband finns?_ "what relation is there?"
- relative determiners: _vilken_ "which/what" as in _komma ihåg vilken tidning det var_ "remember which newspaper it was"
- indefinite determiners: _någon_ "any/some" as in _det har inte gjorts någon undersökning_ "there hasn't been any investigation" 
- totality determiners: _alla_ "all"
