### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that in Swedish the decimal mark is most often a comma. Thousands
are then separated by either a space or dot.
