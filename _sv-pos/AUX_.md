### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Swedish auxillary verbs can be either tense auxilliaries, passive auxilliaries, or modal auxilliaries.

### Examples

- Tense auxiliaries: _<b>har</b> gjort_ "<b>has</b> done", _<b>kommer (att)</b> göra_ "is going to do", _<b>hade</b> gjort_ "hade done"
- Passive auxiliaries: _<b>blev</b> tvungen_ "was forced", _<b>blir</b> skalad_ "is peeled"
- Modal auxiliaries: _<b>måste</b> skapa_ "must create", _<b>bör</b> leda till_ "should lead to"
