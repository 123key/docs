The Irish autonomous voice is similar to the passive construction, in that the agent of the verb is not (necessarily) specified. However, in this constuction, the object remains in accusative case, as opposed to the nominative case used in the passive voice. The subject in this construction remains anonymous, as a dummy subject.

### `Auto` : autonomous voice

The autonomous voice is formed with a different verb ending: <b>-t(e)ar</b> in the present tense, <b>-(e)adh</b> in the past tense, <b>-f(e)ar,</b> in the future tense, and <b>-f(a)í</b> in the conditional.

#### Examples

* _<b>Tugadh an bhreith</b>_ "the verdict was given"
* _<b>rugadh iníon óg rua d'Eithne</b>_ "a young redheaded daughter was born to Eithne"
