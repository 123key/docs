Irish numeral forms inflect to demonstrate different grammatical roles. 

### `Card` : cardinal numbers

Cardinal numbers can be divided into those without nouns (used in counting, giving the time, etc.), and those with nouns. Those used without nouns use a particle <b>a</b> that is absent in those used with nouns.

#### Examples

* _<b>a haon</b>_ "one"
* _<b>a seacht</b>_ "seven"
* _<b>a sé a chlog</b>_ "six o' clock"
* _<b>dhá bhliain</b>_ "two years"
* _<b>naoi gcapall déag</b>_ "nineteen horses"
* _<b>seasca punt</b>_ "sixty pounds"

### `Pers` : personal numerals

The personal numerals are used for counting people. This system of counting differs from that used with other nouns in the numbers 1 - 12, after that, the form is the same as the cardinal form, or a combination of the two forms.

### Examples

* _<b>duine amháin</b>_ "one person"
* _<b>beirt</b>_ "two people"
* _<b>aon bhean dhéag</b>_ "eleven women"
* _<b>seasca fear</b>_ "sixty men"

### `Ord` : ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers provide a label to objects to order them. In Irish, the form uses the definite particle <b>an</b>. (see [Definite]())

#### Examples

* _<b>an chéad lá</b>_ "the first day"
* _<b>an dara dóigh</b>_ "the second prospect"
* _<b>an 17ú Marta</b>_ "the 17th of March"
