Degree is a feature of adjectives that describe the quality of a noun.

### `Pos` : positive, first degree

States the quality of an object without comparing that quality to those of any other object.

#### Examples


`Cmp` : comparative, second degree

`Sup` : superlative, third degree

In Irish, the comparative and the superlative form is the same. In both cases, the adjective is written in the genitive case. Both the comparative and the superlative require a particle prefix. For the comparative degree, this is _níos_ which corresponds to the English "more". The superlative degree has particle _is_, which can be loosely translated as "the most".

#### Examples

* _níos fada_ "longer"
* _níos mó_ "bigger"

* _is fearr_ "the best"
* _is mó_ "the biggest"
