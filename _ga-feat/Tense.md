Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took / takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to another action in the utterance. Verbs in Irish are divided into regular and irregular conjugations. Regular verbs fall into one of two conjugation patterns; short verbs (e.g. _mol, bris_) and long verbs (e.g. _ceannaigh, éirigh_). Verb endings can be either broad or slender (see [NounType]()).

### `Past` : past tense

The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current moment. In Irish, past tense is indicated in the verb through the addition of lenition and/or a d'- prefix. 

#### Examples

* _<b>Bhí</b> a ngruanna faoi lasadh._ "Their cheeks <b>were</b> glowing."
* _<b>D'fhan</b> sé ansin inné._ "He <b>stayed</b> there yesterday."

### `Pres` : present tense

The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that habitually happen. 

#### Examples

* _<b>Tá</b> sé ina chodladh._ "He <b>is</b> asleep."
* _<b>Dathaíonn</b> siad na pictiúir._ "They <b>colour in</b> the pictures."

### `Fut` : future tense

The future tense denotes actions that will happen after the current moment. In Irish, the future is indicated by the addition of a -f-, or -ó- suffix, with endings depending on person.

* _<b>Caithfidh</b> mé sin a fhoghlaim!_ "I <b>have</b> to learn that!"
* _<b>Tosóidh</b> an cheolchoirm ar 8pm._ "The concert <b>will start</b> at 8PM."
