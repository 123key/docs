###  `Yes` : it is reflexive 

The reflexive feature is a boolean feature of pronouns or determiners. It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. it refers to the subject of its clause.

In Irish, the reflexive pronoun is <b>féin</b>

#### Examples

* _<b>bhí fhios agam cheana féin</b>_ "I already knew"
* _<b>bhí a chiall féin do gach duine ina thaibhreamh féin</b>_ "Everybody's own meaning was in his own dream"
