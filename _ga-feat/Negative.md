There is no word for "yes" or "no" in Irish. Instead, a negative particle is used in combinationg with the verb to give a negative polarity to the construction. 

The negative particle _ní_* is used before verbs in almost every tense, except the past. It causes lenition where this is possible, otherwise there is no change. In the past tense the particle is written as _níor_, and doesn't affect the inflection. 

The interrogative negative particle _nach_ is used to pose a negative question. 

The verb "to be" (in Irish _bí_) is given the negative form _níl_ in the present tense, as a contraction of _ní bhfuil_. It can inflect to show (for instance) person.

*In the Ulster dialect, this particle also appears as _cha_ (see [Dialect]())

### `Neg` : negative
