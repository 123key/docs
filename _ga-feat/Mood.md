Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms. It allows for a speaker to express their attitude towards what they are saying.

### `Ind` : indicative mood

The indicative mood can be considered the default form of a verb. A verb in the indicative indicates something that has happened, is happening or will happen. 

#### Examples

* _Deirim_ "I say"
* _Conas a rith sé?_ "How did he run?"
* _Rachaidh sibh_ "You will go"

### `Cnd` : conditional mood

The conditional mood is used to express actions that are hypothetical or contrary to known fact. In Irish, the conditional is expressed in two different verb endings; these endings begin with the suffix -<b>f</b>- or -<b>ó</b>-. In all but the 3rd person singular and the 2nd person plural, the verb endings are synthetic and do not require a subject pronoun.

#### Examples

* _Dhíolfá_ "You would sell"
* _Cheannóidís_ "They would buy


### `Imp` : imperative mood

The imperative mood is used to give a command, express advice, or make a request. The imperative in Irish can be found in all 3 persons, both singular and plural, though the 1st person singular is usually 

#### Examples

* _Bris an fhuinneog!_ "Break the window!"


### `Sub` : subjunctive mood

In Irish, the subjunctive mood is used to express a wish, or something that is not directly stated to be factual. It is normally formed with the particle <b>go</b> followed by the verb in the subjunctive form.

#### Examples

* _Go dtuga Dia ciall duit_ "May God give you sense"
* _Go dté tú slán_ "May you be well"
