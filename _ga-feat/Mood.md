Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms. It allows for a speaker to express their attitude towards what they are saying.

### `Ind` : indicative mood

The indicative mood can be considered the default form of a verb. A verb in the indicative indicates something that has happened, is happening or will happen. 

#### Examples

* _<b>deirim</b>_ "I say"
* _<b>Conas atá sé?</b>_ "How is he?"
* _<b>Breacfaidh mé síos</b>_ "I will jot down"

### `Cnd` : conditional mood

The conditional mood is used to express actions that are hypothetical or contrary to known fact. In Irish, the conditional is expressed in two different verb endings; these endings begin with the suffix -<b>f</b>- or -<b>ó</b>-. In all but the 3rd person singular and the 2nd person plural, the verb endings are synthetic and do not require a subject pronoun. Conditional clauses are often introduced using <b>go</b> or <b>dá</b>.

#### Examples

* _<b>ólfadh sé</b>_ "he would drink"
* _<b>Dá bhfeicfeá</b>_ "if you saw"
* _<b>go bhfeicfeadh sé</b>_ "that he would see"

### `Imp` : imperative mood

The imperative mood is used to give a command, express advice, or make a request. The imperative in Irish can be found in all 3 persons, both singular and plural, though the 1st person singular is usually 

####  Examples

* _<b>Ná habair liom</b>_ "Don't tell me"
* _<b>bígí ar ais anseo</b>_ "be back here"
* _<b>Chuiridís oilithrigh amach</b>_ "they sent the pilgrims out"

### `Sub` : subjunctive mood

In Irish, the subjunctive mood is used to express a wish, or something that is not directly stated to be factual. It is normally formed with the particle <b>go</b> followed by the verb in the subjunctive form.

#### Examples

* _<b>Go n-imí an diabhal do bhóthar</b>_ "May the devil be gone from your way"
* _<b>go raibh sé</b>_ "that he be"
* _<b>na Roinne Oideachais</b>_ "the Departement of Education"
