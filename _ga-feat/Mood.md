Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms. It allows for a speaker to express their attitude towards what they are saying.

### `Ind` : indicative mood

The indicative mood can be considered the default form of a verb. A verb in the indicative indicates something that has happened, is happening or will happen. 

#### Examples

* _<b>deirim</b>_ "I say"
* _Conas <b>atá</b> sé?_ "How is he?"
* _<b>Breacfaidh</b> mé <b>síos</b>_ "I will <b>jot down</b>"

### `Cnd` : conditional mood

The conditional mood is used to express actions that are hypothetical or contrary to known fact. In Irish, the conditional is expressed in two different verb endings; these endings begin with the suffix -<b>f</b>- or -<b>ó</b>-. In all but the 3rd person singular and the 2nd person plural, the verb endings are synthetic and do not require a subject pronoun. Conditional clauses are often introduced using <b>go</b> or <b>dá</b>.

#### Examples

* _<b>ólfadh</b> sé_ "he <b>would drink</b>"
* _Dá <b>bhfeicfeá</b>_ "if you <b>saw</b>"
* _go <b>bhfeicfeadh</b> sé_ "that he <b>would see</b>"

### `Imp` : imperative mood

The imperative mood is used to give a command, express advice, or make a request. 

####  Examples

* _<b>Ná habair</b> liom_ "<b>Don't tell</b> me"
* _<b>bígí</b> ar ais anseo_ "<b>be</b> back here"
* _<b>Chuiridís</b> oilithrigh amach_ "let them <b>send</b> the pilgrims out"

### `Sub` : subjunctive mood

In Irish, the subjunctive mood is used to express a wish, or something that is not directly stated to be factual. It is normally formed with the particle <b>go</b> (positive) or <b>nár</b> (negative) followed by the verb in the subjunctive form. <b>Sula</b> 'before' is sometimes also used.

#### Examples

* _Go <b>n-imí</b> an diabhal do bhóthar_ "<b>May</b> the devil <b>be</b> gone from your way"
* _I nDáil na bhFlaitheas go <b>raibh</b> sé_ "that he <b>was</b>"
* _
* _
* _gan stoc a <b>shéide</b>_ "without a trumpet to <b>blow</b>"
