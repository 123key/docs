Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and other parts of speech (adjectives) that mark agreement with nouns.

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence. For example, the nominative and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb, while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

In Irish four cases are used: common (which covers nominative and accusative case), vocative, genitive and dative. These cases are labelled as `NomAcc`, `Voc`, `Gen`, and `Dat`.

### `NomAcc` : common case

The common case is the base form of the noun, and is used in the citation form (lemma).
This word form is used for subjects and objects of a clause, and predicates of a copula.

#### Examples

* _Bhí <b>Caitríona</b> sé bliana d'aois._ "<b>Caitriona</b> was six years old."
* _Tá sé thíos <b>staighre</b>._ "He is <b>downstairs</b>."
* _<b>Cailín</b> is ea í._ "She is a <b>girl</b>."

### `Voc` : vocative case

The vocative case is used to direcly address someone, and is preceded by the particle `a`.

#### Examples

* _'Slán leat, a <b>Dhoráid</b>!_ "Goodbye, <b>Dorád</b>!"

### `Gen` : genitive case

The genitive case indicates possesion, as denoted by the English preposition 'of'.
It is also used to describe the composition of an object. Objects of a compound preposition are also written in the genitive case.

#### Examples

* _Tá dearadh fisiciúil an <b>stáitse</b> ag teacht leis an ábhar._ "There's a physical <b>state</b> outlook being brought in."
* _D'fhág an bád a chonaic mac an <b>fhir</b>._ "The boat that the <b>man's</b> son saw left."

### `Dat` : dative case

The dative case is used with most simple prepositions in Irish. In standard Irish, the dative form is identical to the common case.

#### Examples

* _An mhaidin dar <b>gcionn</b>, dhúisigh mé go tobann agus d'amharc mé timpeall orm._ "The morning <b>after</b>, I awoke suddenly and looked around me."
