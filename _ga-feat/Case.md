Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs, articles) that mark agreement with nouns.

In Irish four cases are used: common (which covers nominative and accusative case), vocative, genitive and dative. These cases are labelled respectively as `NomAcc`, `Voc`, `Gen`, and `Dat`.

### `NomAcc` : common case

The common case is the base form of the noun, and is used in the citation form (lemma).
This word form is used for subjects and objects of a clause, and predicates of a copula.

#### Examples

##### Subjects:
* _Tosóidh an <b>cheolchoirm</b> ar 8pm_ "The <b>concert</b> will start at 8pm"
* _Chabhraigh an <b>leon</b> le Micí_ "The <b>lion</b> helped Mickey"

##### Objects:
* _Cuireann Paul an <b>píosa</b> seo chugainn_ "Paul offers this <b>piece</b> to us"
* _D'ith sí an <b>dinnéar</b>_ "She ate the <b>dinner</b>"

##### Predicates:
* _is <b>láithreán</b> uafásach é seo_ "this is an awful <b>site</b>"
* _Is <b>múinteoir</b> é_ "He is a <b>teacher</b>"

### `Voc` : vocative case

The vocative case is used to mark a noun as being the addresse. It is preceded by the particle `a`. The vocative case triggers lenition in the word.

#### Examples

* _'Slán leat, a <b>Dhoráid</b>!_ "Goodbye, <b>Dorád</b>!"
* _a <b>dhaoine uaisle</b>_ "ladies and gentlemen"

### `Gen` : genitive case

The genitive case indicates possesion or ownership. It's use is similar to the use of <b>'s</b> in English. Other use cases include describing the composition of an object, compound nouns, or objects of a compound preposition.

#### Examples

* _dearadh an <b>stáitse</b>_ "outloook of the <b>state</b>"
* _mac an <b>fhir</b>_ "son of the <b>man</b>"
* _an <b>Aontais Eorpaigh</b>_ "the European Union"

### `Dat` : dative case

The dative case is used with most simple prepositions in Irish. In standard Irish, the dative form is identical to the common case.

#### Examples

* _in <b>Eireann</b>_ "in <b>Ireland</b>"
* _le <b>hEireann</b>_ "with <b>Ireland</b>"
