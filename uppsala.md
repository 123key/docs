## Future work

Based on the group reports, issues can be sorted into two groups:

1. Short-term: issues that were (more or less) settled and can be fixed without modifying the current guidelines.
2. Long-term: issues that need more discussion and/or are (more or less) likely to require modifications to the universal guidelines.

### Short-term issues

1. Coordination: conj relations should always be left-to-right.
2. Names: name relations should always be left-to-right.
3. Infinitive markers: deprel should be "mark" (not "aux"); postag may vary dependent on language but "PART" is the default.
4. Verb particles: deprel should be "compound" (or "compound:prt"), at least for Germanic languages.
5. Reflexives: deprel should be "dobj", "iobj" or "expl" (not "compound").

### Long-term issues
