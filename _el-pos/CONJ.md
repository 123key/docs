A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger
constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

For *subordinating* conjunctions, see [SCONJ]().

In correlative (paired) coordinating conjuctions such as _είτε - είτε_ or 
_ή - ή_ "either - or", both words are annotated `CONJ`.

#### Examples

* _και_ "and", _ή_ "or", _αλλά_ "but"
* _<b>είτε</b> εσύ <b>είτε</b> ο Παύλος_ "<b>either</b> you <b>or</b> Pavlos"
