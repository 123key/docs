### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

The `NUM` tag is used for digit numerals (_3 / 3._), roman numerals (_III / III._), cardinal word numerals (_tri_ "three") and generic numerals (_troje_ "three sets of").

Other word types expressing a number or a relation to a number in Slovenian are marked as [adjectives](ADJ) (_tretji_ "the third", _trojen_ "triple"), [adverbs](ADV) (_trikrat_ "three times", _tretjiƒç_ "the third time") or [nouns](NOUN) (_tretjina_ "a third", _trojica_ "triplet", _trojka_ "number three").
