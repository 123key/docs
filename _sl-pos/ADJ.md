### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. Adjectives in Slovenian normally agree in gender, case and number with the noun they modify (both in attributive and predicative position), e.g. _velik škandal_ "a big scandal" (masculine nominative singular), _v velikih podjetjih_ "in big companies" (neuter locative plural) and _Ponudba je velika._ "The offer is big." (feminine nominative singular). 

In accordance with the universal description of `ADJ`, some words that have traditionally been categorized as numerals in Slovenian are also treated as adjectives, as they display morphological and syntactic properties of adjectives. These include ordinal written numerals (e.g. _prvi_ "the first", _drugi_ "the second", _tretji_, "the third") and tuples (e.g. _enojen_ "single", _dvojen_ "double", _trojen_ "triple").

In the same way, all adjectival participles are classified as adjectives, regardless of whether they are used as attributes (e.g. _prepovedane substance_ "forbidden substance"), in copula constructions (e.g. _kajenje je prepovedano._ "smoking is forbidden") or in passive constructions (e.g. _to ji je bilo prepovedano_ "it was forbidden to her").

### Examples
