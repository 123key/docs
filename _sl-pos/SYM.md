### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both. Symbols are distinct from [punctuation](PUNCT) that delimit linguistic units in printed text and do not have any semantic function.

As opposed to universal guidelines, tokens containing alphanumeric characters, such as URL addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers, are not considered symbols in Slovenian. 


### Examples

- _$, %, °, µ_
- _#, @, ©, &_ 
- _+, ×, =, <, >_
