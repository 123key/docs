### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs).

In Slovenian, particles, such as _ja_ "yes" and _no_ "no", are always tagged as particles regardless whether they are used as feedback particles (_Ne, motiš se_ "No, you are wrong.") or as modal particles (_Ne motiš se_ "You are not wrong").

### Examples

- _tudi_ "also"
- _ne_ "no/not"
- _še_ "yet/more"
- _že_ "already"
- _le_ "only/just"
- _naj_ "should"
- _samo_ "only"
- _prav_ "ok/just"
- _predvsem_ "mostly"
- _sicer_ "else"
- _celo_ "even"
- _seveda_ "of course"
