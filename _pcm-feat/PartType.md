We use the `PartType` feature to distinguish the different roles performed by the [particles](pcm-pos/PART) of Naija.

This feature can take two values :

+ Cop : copular
+ Disc : discourse

### `Cop`: copular

The particle is considered copulative when it is used to link a subject with its nonverbal predicate. In Naija, the subject may be omitted. 

#### Example

* _<b>na</b> big lie_ "it's a big lie"

Note : _na_ is a copulative particle frequently used for focalization, such as in [pcm-overview/specific-syntax#clefts]()

### `Disc`: discourse

The PartType feature takes this value for discourse particles elements such as _sha_ or _o_.

#### Example

* _Adam, ehen where your babe <b>o</b>_ "Adam, ehen where is your babe ?"
