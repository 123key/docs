In Naija the `Mood` feature which expresses modality is a feature of [auxiliaries](pcm-pos/AUX) and [verbs](pcm-pos/VERB).

There are three values for this feature :

+ Ind : indicative (?)
+ Imp : imperative (?)
+ Jus : jussive


The `Ind` `Imp` values are only carried by instances of verbs following the English morphology, e.g _teaches, teaching, taught..._

### `Ind`: indicative



#### Example



### `Imp`: imperative


#### Example



### `Jus`: jussive

The jussive aspect is used to exhort someone to do something. It is carried by the auxiliary _make_.

#### Example

* _<b>make</b> you dey tink of oda people_ "you should think of other people"
