This document is a placeholder for the language-specific documentation
for `Aspect`.

This feature can take three values :

+ Real : realis
+ Imp : imperfective
+ Perf : perfect

### `Real`: realis



#### Example

* _tire go <b>come</b> burst_ "the tire would explode"

### `Imp`: imperfect

The imperfect aspect is used to indicate ongoing processes.

#### Example

* _dey_

### `Perf`: perfect

The perfect aspect is used to indicate that a process occurred and was completed before the time under consideration. The focus may therefore be on the resulting state rather than on the event itself.

#### Example

* _im <b>don</b> happen_ "it has happened"
* _we <b>neva</b> eat_ "we haven't eaten"
