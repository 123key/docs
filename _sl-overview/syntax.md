# Syntax

The current version of the Slovene UD Treebank does not include any dependency relations, as syntactic mapping from [JOS dependency annotation scheme] (http://eng.slovenscina.eu/tehnologije/razclenjevalnik) to [Universal dependency relations] (http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/u/dep/index.html) is still a work in progress.
