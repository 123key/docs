# Syntax

The syntactic annotation of the Slovenian UD Treebank has been obtained by automatic conversion from [JOS dependency annotation scheme](http://eng.slovenscina.eu/tehnologije/razclenjevalnik), based on a large set of rules including different lexical, morphological and syntactic features. Online guidelines for syntactic annotation are still a work in progress.
