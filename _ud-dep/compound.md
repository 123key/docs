*compound* is one of the three relations in USD for compounding.

It is used for 

- any kind of X<sup>0</sup> compounding: noun compounds (e.g., *phone book*), but also verb and
adjective compounds that are more common in other languages (such as
Persian or Japanese light verb constructions)

<div class="sd-parse">
Phone book
compound(book, Phone)
</div>


- for numbers

<div class="sd-parse">
I have four thousand sheep
compound(thousand, four)
</div>

<div class="sd-parse">
I lost $ 3.2 billion
compound(billion, 3.2)
</div>


- for particles of phrasal verbs:

<div class="sd-parse">
put up
compound(put, up)
</div>

The two other compounding relations are:

- *mwe* for fixed grammaticized expressions with function words (e.g., *instead of*:
*mwe*(of,instead), Fr. plutôt que "rather than": *mwe*(que,plutôt))

- *name* for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements
