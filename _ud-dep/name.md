## name

*name* is one of the three relations for compounding in USD. It is used for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements. For example, *name* would be used between the words of "Hillary Rodham Clinton" or "Carl XVI Gustaf" but not to replace the usual relations in a phrasal or clausal name like "The Lord of the Rings" or "The king of Sweden".


<div class="sd-parse">
Carl XVI Gustaf
name(Gustaf-3, Carl-1)
name(Gustaf-3, XVI-2)
</div>

But regular syntactic relations in:

<div class="sd-parse">
The king of Sweden
det(king-2, The-1)
nmod(king-2, Sweden-4)
case(Sweden-4, of-3)
</div>
