## ncmod: nominalized clause modifier

The *ncmod* relation is parallel to the *nmod* relation, but following the principle that dependencies do mark where new
clauses are introduced, we use *ncmod* for nominalized clause modifiers (of a NP or a VP).

Modifiers labeled *ncmod* depend either on a noun (group “noun dependents”) or on a predicate (group “non-core dependents of clausal predicates”).
