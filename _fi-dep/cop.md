## cop (copula)

Copular clauses receive a special treatment in the SD scheme. The predicative acts as the head word of the clause, and the copular verb depends on it using a `cop` (*copula*) dependency. The only copular verb in Finnish is *olla* (see ISK <a href="http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=891">ยง891</a>). 

<!-- TODO Distinguishing copular structures from other constructs as well as recognizing the subject and the predicative is discussed in Section [copulas](#sec-copulas). -->
