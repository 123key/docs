title:  'reparandum'
shortdef : 'overridden disfluency'

We use `reparandum` to indicate disfluencies overridden in a speech
repair. The disfluency is the dependent of the repair.

(TODO: Finnish `reparandum` example)

Note/diff: `reparandum` is not annotated in TDT and is not used in
the current version of the UD Finnish corpus.
