The dependency relation `foreign` is used to label sequences
of unanalyzed foreign words. These are annotated without regard
to internal structure, marking all words in the sequence direct
dependents of the head.

Contrary to the general UD definition of [u-dep/foreign](), in
UD Finnish the last word in a sequence of foreign words is
considered the head.
