title: 'acl'
shortdef: 'clausal modifier of noun'
---

`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a noun, in
contrast to the [advcl]() relation which is used for adverbial clauses
that modify a predicate. The head of the `acl` relation is the noun
that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that
modifies the noun.
