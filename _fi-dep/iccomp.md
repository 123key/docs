## iccomp (infinite clausal complement) <a name="sec-iccomp"></a>

The dependency type `iccomp`, which stands for *infinite clausal complement*, is a subtype of `ccomp` (*clausal complement*). It is used for clausal complements where the complement clause has a different subject from that of the governing clause and is infinite, i.e. where the verb is an infinitive or a participle. 

<!-- TODO The differences between types of verbal dependents, such as `iccomp`, are thoroughly discussed in Section [verbal](#sec-verbal). -->
