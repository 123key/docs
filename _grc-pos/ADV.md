### Definition

Adverbs can be morphologically defined as a set of words whose form is fixed. A number of adverbs were originally nouns in a certain case (see, for example, the adverbial accusative in Smyth 1920: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+1606&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007">361</a>). Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Adverbs have to be distinguished from particles, even though the criteria for such distinction are not always clear-cut (see definition for <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_grc-pos/PART.md">PART</a>).
