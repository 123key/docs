### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation [flat:foreign](flat) is typically used in the syntactic analysis).  This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech. For example, in _նա նոր գաջեթների սիրահար է_,
_գաջեթ_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

### Examples

- _Եվ ապա նա պարզապես <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>_ “And then he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>”
