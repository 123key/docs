### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Armenian nouns have the lexical feature [Animacy]() and [Materiality](). Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [Number]() and [Case]().

All adjectives and some of the adverbs may function as a noun without additional derivation. In this cases, we keep the POS tag of the original word, but assign nominal features to the word. (TODO: this needs more discussion)

### Examples

- _աղջիկ_&nbsp; “girl”
- _կատու_&nbsp; “cat”

- _օդ_&nbsp; “air”
- _գեղեցկություն_&nbsp; “beauty”
- _լող_&nbsp; “swimming”
