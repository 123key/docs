### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups
used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and
_§_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

There is “infixed” punctuation (exclamation, emphasis and question marks). We refer to such cases as multiword tokens.
