### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a subordinate clause.

Subordinating conjunctions in Chinese include all markers of subordinate clauses, including conditional clauses, temporal clauses, purpose clauses, etc.

In paired clauses where both clauses are marked by a conjunctive word, we treat the first clause as subordinate and thus its conjunctive word as SCONJ, whereas the one in the second, main clause as an adverb (ADV). For example, 雖然/SCONJ... 可是/ADV... / _suīrán... kěshì... "Although... however...".

The object relativizer 所 / _suǒ_ is also tagged SCONJ.

### Examples
