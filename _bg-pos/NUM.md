### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(four)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_. 

In the Bultreebank tagset the tag which maps to `NUM`, is `Mc#`.
