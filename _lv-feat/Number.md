Latvian features number for nouns ([`NOUN`](), [`PROPN`]()), adjectives ([`ADJ`]()), numerals ([`NUM`]()), verbs ([`VERB`]()) and some pronouns ([`PRON`]() and [`DET`]()).

Values used:

* `Sing`
* `Plur`
* `Ptan`
* `Coll` - might be used unevenly as it is hard distinguish from `Sing`

Theoretically possible values:

* `Dual` - older texts feature forms like _abi roki_ "both hands", however it is so rare in contemporary language that it is absent from corpus.

Values not present in Latvian:

* `Tri`
* `Pauc`
* `Grpa`
* `Grpl`
* `Inv`
