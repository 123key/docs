### Definition
We follow the definition for `DET` proposed in the universal scheme.
However note that at the moment numerals are not consistently annotated as `NUM`, and are sometimes marked as `DET`.

### Examples

- articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or givenness): _le, la, les_
- possessive determiners: _mon, ton, son, ma, ta, sa, leur, mes, tes, ses, notres, votres, leurs_
- demonstrative determiners: e.g., _ce, cet, cette_ as in _J'ai vu <b>ce</b> v√©lo hier._
- interrogative determiners: _quel, quelle_ as in _"<b>Quelle</b> couleur aimez-vous?"_
- relative determiners: _quel, quelle_ as in _"Je me demande <b>quelle</b> couleur vous aimez."_
- quantity/quantifier determiners: _aucun_, _tous_ (as in "tous les").
