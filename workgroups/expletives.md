# Working Group on Expletives

As a tentative definition of expletives, we can characterize them as pro-forms (typically third person pronouns or locative pro-adverbs) that occur in core argument positions but are non-referential (and therefore not assigned a semantic role). Below we review the range of constructions where expletives have been claimed to occur and discuss alternative analyses. 

## Subject Expletives

The first type of construction where expletives are found are those involving impersonal verbs, or 0-place predicates, including so-called weather verbs.

1. It rains
2. Il pleut

### Impersonal Verbs

### Presentation Constructions

### Extraposed Clauses
