# Working Group on Expletives

As a tentative definition of expletives, we can characterize them as pro-forms (typically third person pronouns or locative pro-adverbs) that occur in core argument positions but are non-referential (and therefore not assigned a semantic role). There are two main issues regarding expletives in UD:

1. In which constructions are expletives found?
2. Should expletives be treated as core arguments or not?

Below we first review the range of constructions where expletives have been claimed to exist and then discuss the relation between expletives and core arguments. 

## Subject Expletives

Expletives in subject position have traditionally been postulated in (at least) three types of constructions:

1. Weather verbs
2. Existential sentences
3. Extraposition of clausal subjects

Weather verbs are 0-place predicates like "rain" and "snow", which typically take an expletive pronoun as their subject in languages that do not allow pro-drop. In this case, the predicate never assigns a semantic role to its subject and there is no other potential argument in the clause. The Swedish and Norwegian UD treebanks currently use [expl()] for the subject of weather verbs, while Dutch uses [nsubj()].
