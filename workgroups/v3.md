# Working Group on v3 Guidelines

As of now, there is no plan and no fixed date for the next version of the UD
guidelines. However, it is likely that there will be a version 3 at some point
in the future. This is the place where suggestions for later discussion are
collected.

* Relations: We distinguish between dependents of clauses (e.g., [obl]())
  and parts of nominal phrases (e.g., [nmod]()). Do we also want to have a
  third complete set of dependents that modify modifier words such as adjectives
  and adverbs?
* Features: At present, causative is a [Voice](). However, in some languages
  (Turkish?) it is orthogonal to other voices. Thus we have plain active, plain
  passive, causative active and causative passive. Should we make the causative
  an independent boolean feature instead? `Causative=Yes`?
