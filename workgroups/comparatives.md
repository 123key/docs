# Working Group on Comparative Constructions

A prototypical comparative construction involves a quality or property whose
extent is compared, the entity being compared, and the standard of comparison.
Thus in [en] _Stephan is taller than Joakim,_ Stephan is the entity compared,
Joakim represents the standard of comparison to which Stephan is compared,
and the adjective _taller_ denotes the quality that is compared, i.e.,
tallness.

Adverbs can be compared as well, e.g. in
[cs] _Michal mluví lépe než Miloš_ “Michal speaks better than Miloš”,
the word _lépe_ is an adverb and it denotes the quality of Michal's speaking
rather than of his personality in general.

Finally, we can also compare quantities, as in
_Melanie has more money than Sue,_ or in
_There is more than one way of doing it;_
in the latter example, the standard of comparison is conflated with the entity
counted. Similarly, there are sentences where both the standard of comparison
and the new value are hidden in the verb:
_The prices of homes have more than doubled._

The syntax of comparative constructions poses various challenges for linguistic
theory. For English, many of these are discussed in Bresnan (1973) and
Huddleston and Pullum (2002, chapter 13). A cross-linguistic survey of equality
comparison is provided in Haspelmath (2017).

There are no UD relations designed specifically to mark comparative
constructions. This page documents what regular UD means are used to analyze
these constructions and how they are applied.
