# Working Groups for Guidelines

As discussed at the [brainstorming meeting in Pisa](http://universaldependencies.org/misc/brainstorming-pisa-09-18-2017.html) and elsewhere, we need to develop more detailed guidelines for many linguistic phenomena. We therefore want to create topical working groups that can collect examples from different languages, discuss how these examples can be analyzed in a way that is consistent with the universal guidelines as well as consistent across languages, and propose guidelines that can be incorporated in the documentation of the universal guidelines.

1. [Core and oblique arguments and adjuncts](core.html)
1. [Enhanced dependencies](enhanced.html)
3. [Existentials](existentials.html)
5. [Expletives](expletives.html)
2. [Multiword expressions](mwe.html)

* [Suggestions for v3 guidelines](v3.html)

# List of phenomena to be documented

* Simple verbal clauses (intransitive, transitive, ditransitive?; core vs. oblique arguments)
* Simple noun phrases
* Modifiers (obliques and adverbials; adjectives; adverbs modifying nouns; modifiers modifying other modifiers)
* Coordination (of simple noun phrases or simple clauses; difference from parataxis?)
* More about simple clauses
  * Valency-changing operations (passive, antipassive, causative, applicative)
  * Expletives, multiple realizations of arguments
  * Existential clauses
  * Nonverbal clauses
  * Complex predicates
    * Auxiliaries
    * Light verbs
    * Serial verbs
  * Modal verbs
  * Negation
  * Questions (yes/no-questions, wh-questions)
  * Commands, vocative
* Subordinate clauses
  * Complement clauses
    * “Complement” clauses of nouns (`acl:comp`?)
  * Subject clauses
  * Adverbial clauses
  * Relative clauses
    * Free relatives
  * Other adnominal clauses
  * Open complements (and secondary predication)
  * Direct speech, indirect/reported speech, indirect questions
* More about noun phrases
  * Compounds (here nominal and perhaps adjectival and numeral, but with a cross-link to verbal, i.e. light/serial verbs, and phrasal verbs)
  * Flat constituents
    * Multi-word named entities
  * Apposition
  * (All of the above should be compared to `nmod` and the dividing line should be drawn.)
* Comparative constructions
* Ellipsis
* Other relations not covered by the above
  * Parataxis, list, fixed, reparandum, goeswith, discourse
* Other stuff
  * Word segmentation (where to segment and where not)
  * Typos and other errors in the underlying text
  * Dates, numbers and measures (and classifiers?)
  * Quoted text in foreign language (e.g. book/movie titles); foreign names; code switching
  * Abbreviations, multi-word abbreviations, acronyms
