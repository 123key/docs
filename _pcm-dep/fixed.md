The `fixed` relation is one of the relations used for multiword expressions (MWEs). It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials. Fixed MWEs are annotated in a flat structure, where all subsequent words in the expression are attached to the first one using the fixed label.


Naija makes little use of the fixed relation and instead analyzes these expressions syntactically when possible.
