# Introduction

[This document is under construction.]

The Swedish Sign Language UD treebank is based on the The Swedish Sign Language Corpus (SSLC), consisting of video and accompanying annotation files (Mesch et al., 2012b, Mesch et al., 2015). The corpus consists of naturalistic, dyadic signing, the majority of the data coming from conversational type texts, and a smaller part coming from elicited narratives. In total, 300 texts have been recorded, distributed over 42 different signers (Mesch, 2012; Mesch et al., 2012a). These texts are being made available through regular updates online as the video files are being edited and the annotation files completed. The annotation files contain six main tiers: four for the sign glosses (i.e. one for each of the hands of the two signers); two for written Swedish translations (i.e. one tier for each signer) (Mesch and Wallin, 2015). All annotations are made with the ELAN software (Wittenburg et al., 2006), producing annotation cells on tiers time-aligned with the video files. The most recent update of the SSLC contains 48,690 tokens, spanning just over 6 hours of video data, distributed across 85 files and 42 signers.
