The `Tense` feature applies to verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()),
specifying the time when the action took or takes place, in
relation to the current moment or to another action in the
utterance.

`Tense` does not apply to non-finite verbs (infinitives and
participles), the negation verb *ei*, or verbs in the
conditional, imperative, or potential forms.

### Pres: present tense

The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that
usually happen.

Examples:

* [fi] _järjestelmä <b>toimii</b>_ "_the system <b>works</b>_"

### Past: past tense / preterite

The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current
moment.

Examples:

* [fi] _joukkue <b>voitti</b>_ "_the team <b>won</b>_"
