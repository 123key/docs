Degree of comparison is typically a feature of some
[adjectives](fi-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](fi-pos/ADV), and
[verbs](fi-pos/VERB) in participle form.

### Pos: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without
comparing it to qualities of others.

Examples:

* [fi] _**uusi** nimi_ “_**new** name_”

### Cmp: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

Examples:

* [fi] _**nuorempi** veli_ “_**younger** brother_”

### Sup: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

Examples:

* [fi] _**paras** tulos_ “_**best** result_”
