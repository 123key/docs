### `Nom`: nominative

The base form, typically used as citation form (lemma).

* [fi] _**koira** juoksee_ “_the **dog** runs_”

### `Acc`: accusative

In many languages used for direct objects of verbs.

We follow ISK in not recognizing the accusative except for the personal pronouns
and _kuka_ “_who_” (<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=1221>,
<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=1226>)

Examples:

* [fi] _näen hänet_ “_I see him/her_”
* [fi] _kenet näet?_ “_who do you see?_”

### `Gen`: genitive

Examples:

* [fi] _**meidän** perheemme_ “_**our** family_”
* [fi] _**vuoden** päivät_ “_the days of the **year**_”
* [fi] _**Turun** Yliopisto_ “_University of **Turku**_”

### `Ins`: instructive

Roughly corresponds to the English *by means of* or *with the aid of*.

Examples:

* [fi] _kaksin **käsin**_ “_using two **hands**_”

### `Par`: partitive

In Finnish the partitive case is an object case that can also express
indefinite quantity or unfinished actions.

* [fi] _rakastan tätä **taloa**_ “_I love this **house**_”
* [fi] _saanko lainata **kirjaa**_ “_can I borrow the **book**_”

### `Dis`: distributive

The distributive case conveys that something happened to every 
member of a set, one in a time. 

Examples: 

* [fi] _kaupungeittain_ “_separately in each city_”

### `Ess`: essive

The essive case expresses a temporary state, often
corresponding to English _as a_.

Examples:

* [fi] _lapsena_ “_as a child / when he/she was a child_”

### `Tra`: translative

The translative case expresses a change of state (_becomes_, _changes to_).

Examples: 

* [fi] _pitkäksi_ “_become long_”
* [fi] _englanniksi_ “_in/into English_”
* [fi] _kello **kuudeksi**_ “_by **six** o'clock_”

### `Com`: comitative / associative

The comitative (also called associative) case corresponds to 
English _together with_.

Examples:

* [fi] _puolisoineen_ “_with his/her spouse_”

### `Abe`: abessive

The abessive case corresponds to the English preposition _without_.

Examples: 

* [fi] _rahatta_ “_without money_”

### `Ine`: inessive

The inessive case expresses location inside of something.

* [fi] _talossa_ “_in the house_”

### `Ill`: illative

The illative case expresses direction into something.

Examples:

* [fi] _taloon_ “_to the house_”

### `Ela`: elative

The elative case expresses direction out of something.

Examples:

* [fi] _talosta_ “_from the house_”

### `Ade`: adessive

The adessive case expresses location at or by something (not
inside and not on the surface of it). The
corresponding directional cases are allative (towards something) and
ablative (from something).

Examples:

* [fi] _pöydällä_ “_at the table_”

### `All`: allative

The allative case expresses direction to something (destination
is adessive, i.e. at or by that something, not on or inside of it).

Examples: 

* [fi] _pöydälle_ “_to the table_”

### `Abl`: ablative

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.

Examples:

* [fi] _pöydältä_ “_from the table_”
* [fi] _katolta_ “_from the roof_”
* [fi] _rannalta_ “_from the beach_”
