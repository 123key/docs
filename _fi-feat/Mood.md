Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](fi-pos/VERB) forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

Examples:

* [fi] _minä **sanon**_ “_I **say**_”

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

Examples:

* [fi] _**kypsennä** uunissa_ “_**fry** in the oven_”

### Cnd: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

Examples:

* [fi] _**tarvistisimme** tilaa_ “_we **would need** space_”

### Pot: potential

The action of the verb is likely but not certain.

Examples:

* [fi] _talo **valmistunee**_ “_the house **will likely be completed**_”
