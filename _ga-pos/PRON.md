#### Description

Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

In Irish, third person pronouns have two forms, roughly corresponding to nominative (e.g. sé) and accusative (e.g. é) cases. Pronouns are often incorporated through inflection in synthetic verb forms and prepositions.
