#### Description

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN`tag is intended for common nouns only. See `PROPN` for proper nouns and `PRON` for pronouns.

##### Common nouns

Irish nouns are either masculine or feminine, and inflect for case and number. In Old Irish, nouns inflected for nominative, accusative and dative cases. All of these are now represented in Modern Irish by what's referred to as the `common' case. An exception to this is pronoun forms, where the subject and object forms differ: _sé_ "he"/ _é_ "him".

The genitive case and vocative case are marked by inflection. 

Each noun falls into one of five declensions.


##### Verbal nouns

Verbal nouns are marked as `NOUN` in the UD scheme. Verbal noun forms are used widely in Irish for the infinitive form (_a dhéanamh_ "to do") and progressive aspectual phrases (_ag déanamh_ "doing/ making").
