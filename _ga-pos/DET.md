#### Description

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. In Irish there are pre-determiners (preceding the noun) and post-determiners (following the noun). 

Articles are pre-determiners. In Irish, there is no indefinite article, only a definite one. The definite article has two forms -- singlular _an_ and plural _na_.

Post-determiners occur with an article, and follow the noun. Some of these are demonstratives (_seo_ "this; _siúd_ "that"; _sin_ "that"; _úd_ "that"). 




#### Examples

##### Pre-determiners
* _an duine_ "the person"
* _na daoine_ "the people"

##### Post-determiners
* _an duine seo_ "this person"
* _an duine sin_ "that person"
* _na daoine siúd_ "those people"
* _an duine eile_ "the other person"
